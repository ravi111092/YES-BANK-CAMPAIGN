                        <div class="stories_div"><b>She was born in a middle-class family and was the youngest of all her siblings. She was almost 13 years younger to her elder sibling. Being, the youngest, she was the darling of her sisters, brother and parents. She was literally life-line of her father, whom she adored most. She grew into a confident girl admired by one and all for her confidence, beautiful smile,compassion towards others and helping attitude. As per her father, she brought prosperity and happiness in their house, soon after birth and he firmly believed her to be the cause behind the continued benevolence of almighty. 
                                At home, her father shielded her from the household chores, much to the exasperation of her mother, who wanted her to learn the basics like cooking etc. Finally, the mother found a way out and she divided the household chores to her three daughters and our celebrity, too got a portion of it. On her maiden visit to the kitchen, she burnt her hand slightly while trying to make soup. Well, was that intentional or a purely accident, one can’t say for sure but that was the last day before her marriage that she entered kitchen. Her father took on her share of responsibility and declared that his favourite daughter was excused the lowly household works like making tea, cooking food etc. That was the more than unconditional love of a father speaking for his daughter. 
                                Her family had a great bonding. Before, retiring to bed at night, they used to play some games as a family and had a habit of having a cup of tea before calling it a day. The one loosing out in the game was assigned the responsibility of making tea for everyone. Father ensured that his younger daughter never lost the game. If despite all types of hook and crook , she couldn’t be saved from loosing the game, the father would make tea himself instead of allowing his daughter to step into the kitchen.

How can she be the most cheerful, optimist, laughing person 24 /7 when the rest of us get upset over small things? But that is how she is! Without a speck of anger or hatred for anyone,she always taught me-you are only going to destroy yourself if you let negative emotions overwhelm you!

I will narrate just one incident out of many to give you a sense of what I mean. Once on board a flight from Kolkata to Guwahati, a young lady, who was a complete stranger to us and who was sitting next to my wife, suddenly fell critically ill. Before my wife could realize what was happening, the lady, who as we subsequently came to know had had some cardiac ailment, suddenly collapsed on my wife's lap without any prior indication. She had lost consciousness and had simply fallen over. We were staggered and scared to the hilt. Just imagine for a second how you would have felt and what would have happened to you if a young lady had fallen down unconscious over you just like that without any rhyme or reason, and that too on board a flight ! We immediately called for help from the flight attendants. Together we splashed some water on her face. Nothing happened. My wife then directly poured some more water on her face from the water bottles the air hostesses had given her.Two bottles were emptied out. Yet she would not come round. My wife then further summoned up courage and started pouring down the third bottle as fast as she could, this time keeping the bottle much higher up and completely vertical to her face so as to accelerate the process and create a heavier impact, and at the same time began massaging her chest, gently at first and then harder, faster and quicker. Time dragged by on laden feet and seemed interminable. It must have been a little over three minutes when we first saw her eyelids flicker. She was beginning to regain her consciousness and our joy knew no bounds when eventually we saw her open her eyes fully. She started crying, and tightly held on to my wife for a couple of minutes and kept on saying timelessly “Thank you ! Thank you so much ! You have saved my life ! I owe you my life !”

She still does not drink though everyone else in these cold climes does. But today 21 years later their marriage is not only strong but an inspiration for many. My mom is my father's best friend and for the last 22 years they have not needed many other friends. They laugh at silly jokes and are ever willing to try out new adventures.

A multitalended lady-top class academics,patent at work,trained classical singer,great artist etc. Amidst the ability to don multiple hats,what I really admire is her unflinching confidence in her abilities and risk appettite.

                                Back in 2012,she had filed a patent at her workplace and was in talks to move to Europe. With an upcoming promotion and a good paycheck,the future was looking bright in her R&D role at an IT giant. However while working in the alumni association events outside of work,she had developed a deep interest in marketing. Around the same time a friend had just started his own firm called Twenty19. She was very interested in exploring a marketing role there in a professional setup. However this radical shift to marketing at an unknown startup was fraught with risks. A failure could have pushed her back in career by a few years. But she backed herself and quit her job,took a massive paycut,and joined Twenty19. 
                                
                                Being a novice,the initial campaigns to attract companies did not take off. Undeterred, she invested in learning through multiple avenues as well as through her mistakes. Through small successes,she kept building the team,and slowly gained strength. The big moment was when the ‘India Internship Report’ that she authored,was launched by the Economic Times. This subsequently became an annual report and was viewed as the most authentic data on the internship space.By 2016, Twenty19 had grown to a sought-after brand in the internship space. A big part of this success can be attributed to her endeavors. With deep passion,persistence and laser-focus,she turned the biggest risk of her life into her biggest achievement,alongside winning numerous awards and recognition. This subsequently helped her bag a seat at the prestigious Indian School of Business.
                                
                                She had demonstrated that one should not fear failure,and that informed risks might be uncomfortable initially,but rewards significantly later.

Jaiswal, my new roommate seemed to be an affable guy but little did we know his intentions. Days went by and the three of us bonded together well, hanging out on occasions and enjoying each other's company. One night around 3 am in the morning I get up to quite snobs beside me. Opening my eyes I see Srija sitting straight up, her head buried inside her palm and a trembling body. She drags me out of the bed, takes me to the other room and tells me something that shook the ground beneath me . Srija woke up to someone pulling her hands out of her breast and the someone was none other than my roommate. A part of me wanted to slit his throat at the very moment but she asked me to act wisely . She embarked on a series of bold moves which would be my most influential story to look upto forever. Srija boldly stood up in front of our classroom and narrated whatever that happened with her to our professors and classmates . Everyone appreciated the fact that she stood up and talked about it, because let's face it, women in our country generally don't and are asked not to. Srija was asked by multiple people to shut up and drop the issue but her fight was to break that very stigma. She received multiple phone calls from Jaiswal's friends and relatives abusing her over the call, calling her names and even giving her death threats. Little did I know that all of it was taking a huge toll on my brave girl. Finally the fateful day came when she put forward the issue to our college principal who immediately took an action and called the cops to investigate the matter and get Jaiswal arrested. Her fight was for all the girls out there who are unable to stand up and ate asked to shun down.

Wants to create her own page for singing and cooking, keeps posting videos for them.. Handles her grandchildren so well and disciplined. Mkes sure the husband always finds her by her under any circumstance...  
                                Also does a lot of social activities...
                                How much ever I talk of her doesn't suffice... She is a gem...  A true fighter and has proved that gender isnt the limit... Sky is!

                                        undivided and unfailing love from them, no matter the circumstances. However,
                                        the onus of us growing
                                        into mature, somewhat worthy and confident humans goes to our mother. Being an
                                        Army wife, she has
                                        handled our various homes and us, almost alone. Every place that my dad got
                                        posted to, she turned
                                        the house we were alloted into our home. No matter where my dad was posted in,
                                        how many occasions he
                                        missed with us or how many holidays we spent at our grandmothers place without
                                        him; the one thing
                                        that was constantly provided us with, was extra care and love from our mom.
                                        While my dad was (and
                                        still is) serving the nation, she was (and still is) taking care of everything.

                                        with us strictly, her care for us, showed up in those scoldings too. To narrow

                                        in our lives. She has made our life (me and my sister) complete, and that's what
                                        we admire the most
                                        in her - she being the person that she is. She has shown us in endless

                                        story is very common. I am a single mother, got divorced in a very young age of
                                        25, as i got married
                                        also when i was 19. Obviously not educated enough by tgat time, hardly
                                        graduation second completed
                                        and that too i remember post marriage only i have given final exams. Marriage
                                        was failed from day
                                        one due to the domestic violence and non respect, i have been in that failed
                                        marriage for 7 lobg
                                        years just to give every bit fron my end so that things might get changed, but
                                        nothing such
                                        happened, now the day comes i have my baby, a sweet little innocent baby, who
                                        does not even know the
                                        meaning of all thises big words i mentioned.
                                        But the situation of my marriage was getting worst day by day. One fine day i
                                        looked at my son and
                                        thought that i am responsible for his future as if somwthing went wrong in his
                                        life it will be my
                                        responsibility. And that very moment was enough to give me the courage of
                                        packing my bags and movibg
                                        out from the door withoit thinking about society and people. It was tough in
                                        starting as managing
                                        son and doing job was not easy, someday the thought also came that i will not be
                                        able to manage, i
                                        should call my aprents for help but then i have stopped myself. I pursued my MBA
                                        during this time
                                        and taken more challenges in professional life. Now as tome passed and its been
                                        7 years i have been
                                        divorced, my son is 8 yrs old and he respect me and every women and me who is

                                        years, she has
                                        been spending almost complete money on these kids, she is having one home for
                                        them which cost 18k
                                        per month but still she is looking after these kids with beautiful smile and
                                        heart. What I like
                                        about her that she herself belongs from azadpur which not a developed area and
                                        she stopped taking
                                        money from her parents when she was in class 7th. She studied in govt. School of
                                        delhi but even then
                                        she is passionate for kids. Now she has registered herself as an ngo in the
                                        month of may 2019, and
                                        she us reaching to more kids. She is trying to work on all the domains which are
                                        really important
                                        for an individual. She stands up when needed in police station at night , she
                                        goes to hospital , she
                                        rescued and counselled a child having sexual harassment in her own home. There
                                        are many ups and
                                        downs in her life in this journey but she never stopped. She hardly stays at
                                        home for any festival
                                        or on any off .

                                        for the justice as it was actually a planned kidnapping but no proof was left
                                        behind. The time he left there was not a single penny in the house. After that
                                        she became bread earner for us. She didnt compromised with our studies and
                                        provided good education to me and my 2 younger brothers.
                                        Now i am a banker and my younger brother is Officer in irrigation dept and

                                        income. She focused on her education despite resistance from a patriarchical
                                        family. She secured a job in the IT industry and has since been working her way
                                        up the hierarchy. She has proved to be a major support for her mother(now

                                        As a husband I have whole heartedly supported her to follow her dreams. We have
                                        two wonderful girls who admire their mother as a role model to emulate in

                                        retaining a sound base of ethics and values.
