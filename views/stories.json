At that time, Laxmi was a 15-year-old teenager. This unfortunate incident left her scarred – both physically and emotionally – for life. Not being the one to give up, she sought the support of many acid victims and filed a petition to curb acid sales in the Supreme Court of India.\r\n\r\nFor her commendable work in helping acid attack victims, Laxmi received the International Women of Courage Award from the then U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. Today, Chhanv Foundation – an NGO run by Laxmi - is the hope and voice of acid attack victims all over the world.",

This lady is an acid attack survivor. But what she did post the attack is nothing even close to be termed as surviving. She gave her life a meaning with a reason to make every action count.\n\nGirls are very sensitive about their outlook and beauty, this girl lost it all because of a social miscreant completelty unaware of the repercussions on ones life. People started sympathizing, making her feel worse. But she held herself strong, accepted the fact and decided to do something about it. What inspires the most is that normally a person gets down and out after losing the most essential society acceptance but this girl not just stood up for herself she just took over like a storm and made sure such incidents does not happen so casually. \n\nI learned from the local journal that her consistent effort made the court define a law controlling the availability of acid to common people. \n\nFor me, this lady is a true inspiration and I would always celebrate HER. She taught us that given this life we should always strive to make our mark in the society. We need to stand out and speak up so that others can take precautions. Feeling depressed and surrendering to life is the easiest a person can do, fighting back and making a difference is what defines a true warrior.\n\nMay this girl keep gaining strength and support to achieve all the success and love in her life.\n\nGod bless!!!\n",

She knows exactly how to plan her expenses, where to invest and where to contain. \n\nUnlike other ladies in her group she is not the one who would crib for what other ladies have better or to be frank costlier than what she has. She knows what is justified. Because of her mental strength and stability, we observed our family grow personally as well as professionally. \n\nThe most inpiring thing is her persistence to continue maintaining  what is justified.  This needs a lot of mental strength, for a housewife its very easy to get finicky about possessing the costly stuff in order to have a status maintained to be ranked high in the social circle. \n\nI have learned a lot from her, I anyway celebrate HER but next when I meet her will surely tell her that I wrote about her somewhere. She would be really happy. Thank you, God bless!",

She inspires me because she follows her heart and her passion. She is a life coach, loves DIY, she dances, paints, sings, runs an NGO, holds healing sessions, keeps her home spaces de-cluttered, is meticulous with how she uses her things. I look up to her because she is everything she wanted to be and not defined by one single identity. She has time and again surpassed the limitations of her own mind, body and spirit by trying to be the best version of her self. She invests time in her own self-practises to gain mastery over herself. I love her because she is a living, embodying example for everyone around. She leads not by words, but by actions. A true leader, with a compassionate heart, an intellectual mind and a beautiful soul.",

Many people say that they want to become like their mother when they grow up but I know I can't because you cannot give up what she gives up for you. So after my father passed my mom took the additional responsibilities. Now she had to earn as well as manage the house. And guess what , she has completely nailed both the roles. She's a brave lady who has faced many problems in her life but has never given up or never let any problem to come on me. She was much interested in studying in her childhood but due to the financial condition of her parents she somehow completed class X. And to the contrary she has done everything so that I can get a good education. From being a best friend , to a critic my mom had played every role in my life. \n From stepping into her beautiful heels that would make me feel on top of the world (even though I would trip over several times), to wrapping myself in her gorgeous saris that would make me feel like a princess, my mother has been there with me through all my thick and thin. She's my real life superhero. Also not only my mom , every mother on this earth is an INSPIRATION! ",

Next quality which i got inspired by her is her Sacrifice,  since we are from normal middleclass family of 4 children she never ever asked even a face cream for herself, sacrificed everything only to see happiness on our face. Because of my mom and great dad me and all my siblings are in good position now. \r\nI just wanted to thank my Mother from the bottom of my heart.

She raised me and my younger brother with great love, care and affection while our parents were professionally employed. I cannot thank her enough for teaching us Punjabi by only talking to us in Punjabi that made us learn the language seamlessly. She has also taught me great recipes such as Kanji drink and Baingan Kachris that are rarely known by kids of my generation. She also recited interesting mythological stories to me and was my friend in reading the Hindi story magazine Nandan. Till date, my grandmother continues to support me and inspire me to see old age with great grace. I know not everyone is very lucky to get old, and old age brings with itself a lot of body problems. Therefore, the never ending enthusiasm to learn new things such as a smartphone by my grandmother at the age of 84 is something that makes me very motivated and positive towards life. I thank God for blessing me with such a sweet, caring and modern grandmother. May God bless her always. ",

        "description": "Nisha did her schooling from a small town in Tamil Nadu. Despite all odds and with no one to guide or help her, she completed her Engineering by getting selected through state merit. She then went on to getting selected as a Gazetted Class 1 Commissioned Officer in the Indian Air Force in one of the initial batches of women officers, paving the way for future generations of women. She was commended for her professionalism and also selected as one among the initial Lady Commanding Officers in a front line operational Air Force base leading her men from the front. After 15 years with IAF and being involved in strategic projects, she moved seamlessly into the Corporate world and has been recognized time and again for her dedication, hard work & professionalism. Nisha has simultaneously mothered 2 lovely daughters and has been a role model as a mother and a wife. As much as she is a professional at work, she is a loving and caring homemaker too. She is an exceptional cook and can anticipate and keep track of everything at home too. She is an amazing baker and has all the elements to take up baking as a profession too. She spends her free time also doing decoupage art work which she uses for gifting her friends. She is well read and never hesitates to lend a helping hand to her friends in times of need. Its amazing to see her multitask everything in her life. She makes it a point to keep in constant touch with her mother and help her out emotionally and financially especially after her father passed away. What's really interesting is how she takes care of her father-in-law too, for his medical treatment.  She has volunteered with NGOs to teach under privileged children and also for flood relief victims and rescuing animals in distress. She speaks up and takes responsibility where she sees something going wrong. A professional, a mother, a wife, a daughter-in-law, a sensitive and sensible woman.... a superwoman! This is why I admire Nisha!",

Why i am participating in this contest is not that i have done somthing which noone has ever done, its becaise to hear my story many girls or women can get inspiration and this story is very common. I am a single mother,  got divorced in a very young age of 25, as i got married also when i was 19. Obviously not educated enough by tgat time, hardly graduation second completed and that too i remember post marriage only i have given final exams. Marriage was failed from day one due to the domestic violence and non respect, i have been in that failed marriage for 7 lobg years just to give every bit fron my end so that things might get changed,  but nothing such happened,  now the day comes i have my baby, a sweet little innocent baby,  who does not even know the meaning of all thises big words i mentioned. But the situation of my marriage was getting worst day by day. One fine day i looked at my son and thought that i am responsible for his future as if somwthing went wrong in his life it will be my responsibility. And that very moment was enough to give me the courage of packing my bags and movibg out from the door withoit thinking about society and people.  It was tough in starting as managing son and doing job was not easy,  someday the thought also came that i will not be able to manage, i should call my aprents for help but then i have stopped myself.  I pursued my MBA during this time and taken more challenges in professional life.  Now as tome passed and its been 7 years i have been divorced,  my son is 8 yrs old and he respect me and every women and me who is now a COO of a company.  Every girl out there should never stop believing in them as its only you who can change your life.  Have a good day. ",

After her mom’s death in a major accident while in car with her father She took admission in distance learning, and completed her degree while taking care of the house and her father. After intense struggle, and working hard day and night, she got selected as the District President at the women cell of an NGO by the name of Guard of Justice and Human Rights and Divisional Director for World Aid Organisation For Human Rights. As they say, if the individual possesses a certain spark, a strong will, no circumstances can come in the way. This proved to be a major step in the making of a woman who would go on to do incredible things for the society. Within an year, she solved 40 cases of domestic violence which now has reached to 300 and served the people in need, breaking several stereotypes in the way. All this hard work got awarded, and she got promoted to the post of National General Secretary of Guard of Justice and Human Rights. She is no less than an icon for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who give her much love and consider her as their role model.\r\nWhile speaking to the ‘Millionaire Sayings’, she said : “ I want to set an example for those who are taken aback by looking at the miseries of life. I am right now the youngest entrepreneur of J&K running my own institute for Spoken English. What I want to tell people is that everything has a purpose. We just need to step onto the right path, rebuild our vision, Smile and move on.” True girl, you really have set an example for the world to look at! Considering the pain of women she is running several free institutes of self defence for women where they are trained for Martial Arts.\r\nUnpredictability is the other name of life. In year 2017 she received Global Icon award followed by Global peace awards in 2018 in Hyderabad on the occasion on International peace day where she was invited as special youngest guest.",

I saw the same version of her, as she stayed determined to not only survive but come out as a warrior. Prachi is married and has three-year old daughter. Today she is out of danger and undergoing medication. She supported and counselled many other cancer patients during and post her treatment. Today, she continues to be a part of cancer help groups. Her passion for life and attitude for staying strong for her daughter and the family inspires me. We worry too much about little stuff when there are warriors like Prachi fighting the real battle.

She believes that real happiness does not lie in success, money, name, and fame but lies within gratitude. Some bad incidence can break you physically and deform your body but transform your soul and turn you in the best version of yours. Today I am talking about Muniba Mazari. \r\n\r\nShe was born in a conservative family. Muniba married at the age of 18 years due to family force as she was not ready to marry nevertheless Muniba Mazari Wedding successfully arranged by her family in 2005. Muniba Mazari husband was an air force pilot in Pakistan army and now he is a commercial pilot in private airlines. Muniba Mazari’s Husband name is Khurram Shahzad who had divorced her in 2015. due to her physical condition.\r\n\r\nAfter a tragic car accident, her doctor told that she would be not able to sit, walk and give birth to a child. However, she can sit now in a wheelchair.\r\nShe is a bachelor’s in fine art and she is running “Muniba’s Canvas”. She claimed that she is a mix media artist, but indeed you will see in her all artistic image that is abstract of a woman’s life. Apart from art, she is also the mother of a child. She has adopted a baby boy, his name is Nael.\r\nToday, she is participating in many social activities. She is helping a poor child and suffering from Thalassemia with the support of UNICEF. She was awarded by many world’s leading organization like WCCI Lahore Division, UN, CGC, The Karc Brothers Award 2017, Forbes 30, BBC’s Top 100 Women, NPC for her work and achievement.",

Her father passed away when she was 12 years old and it befell upon her frail shoulders the responsibility of looking after her family and her agricultural estate from a very early age . The British collector who was her fathers friend helped groom her in the art of reading farming riding and administrating her estate which comprised of 400 acres of farm land. At the age of 24 soon after WW I she was sent by the crown to England representing the women ofrural India who played a role in supplying wheat and rice to the soldiers on the front. Radhabai returned with the images of English villages ingrained in her mind and implemented the sewage system in her village. She was helped in her venture by a strapping young lad whom she went on marry in 1921. The village was transformed overnight and was the cynosure of all the other villages. She had brick roads built and had oil lamp posts similar to the gas lights she had seen in Manchester put up on the road leading to her village. The Commissioner of Kolaba impressed by her entrepreneurship gave her the go ahead for building the Pen Mandwa jetty which made the fishing industry flourish in Raigad district.This design which she had drawn from her memory after visit to Scotland  was adopted in many parts of Maharashtra. Radhabai had 11 children 6 sins and 5 daughter. They  all went on to become famous in their own field of specialisation andwerecsent by her yo pursue higher education in England and America. Radhabai was known for her generosity and helped educate the girls in her village by holding classes in her home teaching Marathi English , History , tailoring and farming. Hers was th only village where superstitions were dispelled and people were taught the science of practical reasoning.  She died at at the ripe old age of 85 a woman of substance. She was my grandmother.",

Like many I also followed her on social media , where thousands asked her for help. By her activeness , it seems that she never slept. Whenever anyone cried for support she immediately took required actions. It's not surprising that millions eyes got wet after her demise. Her achievements are uncountable but what I admire her alot is how she managed work with family. I am from New Delhi , the UT where she became first women chief minister. So, my attachment towards her from my childhood. Being always on crucial position she balanced her work life balance . As a working woman I can say it would be taughest phase.\nAnother mesmerizing part of character is her speeches. Irrespect of the platform or agenda , her words were equally effective. Everytime she stood to speak, usage of her words, representation of critical issues , expression of her thoughts made everyone speechless. \nThis amazing lady was loved by everyone. Some believed her principles and practices and some don't but everyone had believe on her. \nWho doesn't want to idealise such person. I am glad that I born at the time when such a great narrator & inspiration lived too. \nSushma swaraj inspired me and will inspire me in future as well. ",

It has those straight, normal, and peaceful times, but it has rough times with twists and turns. I think everyone knows this, but some people have worse experiences than others. Those experiences cannot be avoided and have to be faced. Everyone always faces those experiences differently as they come. The ones that face the experiences with the bright hearts and their heads held high are those that inspire me every single day to keep going.\r\n\r\nMy mother has held her head high every day while facing her daily experiences and still continues to hold her head up high and inspire me every day\r\nShe got married to my dad on Aug 15th, 1989. She  have me,(her first child) june 7th, 1991, about five years later. I observed My mom , she take my family responsibility and she start forming and clothes sales , what she earnings that all money she spent my studies , only she had one time food in my childhood days , finally me and my brother completed Btech and got a good job , now I am working as RF engineer and my younger brother working as Assistant Engineer.\r\n\r\nWith raising two kids and having a part-time job as a marketing analyst, she had a lot on her plate, yet she always made it all work. Running between three different schedules of two different kids and her work with all different sets of friends and interests must not be an easy task. Especially at one point when two of those kids were in diapers at the same time! I saw how difficult that was, I saw my mom work really hard to make everything work within our house. Yes, it wasn’t perfect, but she always kept her head up and kept going.\r\nThat is truly something that has always inspired me, and one thing that has always made me want to always keep moving forward in my life. My mom keeping her head up showed me that I could keep my head up too, every single day.\r\nShe was always there with encouragement whe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It doesn't mean to do the same the others do, but to take lessons from the life of great peoples.\r\n\r\nActually, we can't survive our life , same as the great peoples, who touched the high pills of sky, but we can take lessons from their life.\r\n\r\nComing to my inspiration, my inspiration is this whole universe.\r\n\r\nYeah ! I got inspired by the whole universe. The first inspiration of my life is my mumma. She had taught me a lot of things that I must say, I would not get it anywhere. My mother is my role modal. She is being inspire me from childhood age only\r\n",

Since childhood, she’s been the perfect all rounder girl - good at everything from painting to dance to studies, her focus crystal clear that she wants to achieve something in life. So she’s been working for some 8-9 years and out of that last 6 years in Singapore. Comfortable and happy. She’s  been an inspiration since childhood because she always seemed to be doing it right. And now you see her - she’s a mother of a 3 year old. Her focus has shifted from herself to her baby and truth be told, I haven’t seen a better mother in my 26 years of existence - given herself up and made her baby the center of her life. Now I can’t pinpoint whether I liked the teenager that she was or the mother that she is - she’s simply embracing her life phases with gleaming perfection and inspiring everyone around her.",

        "description": "I wanted to share a deeply personal story to show the sacrifice of my wife Kiran every day. Prior to the birth of our daughter, my wife and I had tried several times to have a child. Fortunately, it worked out two different times that my wife was able to conceive and begin carrying. Unfortunately, both times, those future human lives ended in tragedy with miscarriage.\nThese were two of the most devastating moments of my life, and yet I could only imagine how sad and defeated my wife felt. She wondered if something was wrong with her. She initially doubted if it was ever to be — would we have children? Or would we run into the same, terrible fate again? We had a choice in that moment — believe and try again, or give up.\nOf course, she never gives up. So there was really, only one option.\nIt took tremendous courage to try again for another child. Most people don’t realize how difficult and transformative the effect of conceiving and carrying a child is on a woman’s body. Even after only 10 weeks, a woman’s body has changed dramatically. Hormones are running wild. This is a truly magnificent and dynamic undertaking.\nIt’s something that most people don’t speak about. The grieving, suffering and need to build yourself back up emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically. For something so amazing to be taken from you, and to have to reconstruct your dreams, ambitions and hopes, is as challenging a hurdle to overcome as any in life.\nFar too often, women privately have to tackle this experience. Privately, women dig deep into their faith and inner-strength to persevere and come out better, stronger and more beautiful than ever before.\nHer next pregnancy led to the birth of my daughter. I learned in those nine months more about courage, devotion, commitment and strength than I had in all my previous years. We had our baby girl. And we had a treasure trove of life lessons in how incredible a woman’s sacrifice is.\nKiran's example for me changed the way I saw all women.",

I mean it in the sense that she has accomplished many things in her life.\n She has taught me to always try my best, to treat everyone equally, to not give up when things get hard. She tells me to at all times be honest because in the end, lies always hurt more. She instills the importance of family and of doing well at school in me. When I make decisions and she doesn't always agree with them, she makes sure that I know that she is behind me all the way because she wants me to always be happy. She has taught me right from wrong and the significance of self-respect. \n             She is my mother, the greatest influence in my life. Not only as a mom but also as a friend. \nAnother reason why my mother is my favorite person is because she is very blunt. She says what she means and means what she says. \nLife was hard for her, but she never gave up because she knew that she had three young children, who she would die for, waiting at home. She was strong and powerful in every aspect of life: mind, body, and soul. When times got hard, she just thought about us and nothing else, as long as it's what we wanted and if we would benefit from it. She has helped us get through the tears, pain, and hurt of our lives. But how did she feel? No one ever knew, because she never took time for herself, it was all about her children.\n ",

Not only this she believes in giving and says “One who gets a lot from the world is a big man, but the one who gives back to the world is bigger”. These words of my wife always inspire me to give back more to the world. ",

        "description": "Rasheeda, 38, lives in Srinagar, India. 'Brought' to Kashmir by an agent from her village in West Bengal, Rasheeda was married to the fisherman Haji Ghulam Mohd. (the man in the image) who was a widower and more than twice her age. Bride-purchase remains a common practice in Kashmir, not so much because of dearth of women in the Valley, but because older men, widowers or men suffering from physical disabilities (i.e. so-called ineligible men) are not able to  find brides for themselves from the region. Rasheeda inspires me because of her fortitude, her wonderful ability to adapt and her indomitible spirit. Now a mother of two sons, a teenager & a pre-teen, she is the mistress of her house. Her husband's emotional dependence on her testifies to her kind and loving nature. What is more, he reposes complete trust in her. She has also won the respect and love of neighbours, perhaps more than a Kashmiri woman in her place would have. Rasheeda's story teaches us that the human spirit isn't easily vanquished; no matter how far we are from our loved ones, no matter how intimidating our present circumstances (as Radheeda's must have been when she arrived here as a young bride), we must not perish. Like this brave woman, whose face clearly bears the signs of wistful longing for her homeland and mild happiness at the discovery a new life, we must continue to spread cheer and love, no matter where we are.",

My mother is the most authoritative figure in my life. \r\nShe not only took care of me and my brother but also the most favourite Teacher for many students. Yes she was an Elementary school  teacher. \r\nNow, retired after over 20 years of teaching, she continues to support me, She will drop anything she is doing to rush over to my house and help me with my kid. \r\nToday I m proud to say that I am a successful HR professional ,mother , wife and an adorable daughter. I would dedicate this success to my mom who showered us with love , attention, affection and strict values. \r\nThank you for being a wonderful role model. You are such a strong, kind, independent and caring woman and a rockstar mom. If I am even half as amazing of a woman as you are, I will be satisfied. Thank you for setting a wonderful example for me to follow throughout the years, and I am forever grateful for you.  ",

        "description": " Every woman is capable of inspiring any man. The degree of inspiration goes northward with their continuation of hard work, dedication, love and sensivity. \nIn my life, I do agree that I have a great impact on me from my mother. Now, my wife also earn my awes whenever I think of her eternal perseverance for keeping our family bond intact irrespective of the fact that she came from entirely different cultural and social background. \nBut, here I would describe a special, very special event of my life. Due to some failures in competitive exams, I would be negatively charged everytime; negativity was just oozing out of me everytime. I used to complaint about everything everytime. I was so doomed that even when I see the plus sign, i would think its nothing but a combination of two negatives' sign. I earned a sobriquet,  'Nigattu'. \nOne day, while returning from my own city Saharanpur to Roorkee; it was pouring heavily, as usual I was cursing the dancing drops of rain too. Near Bhagwanpur turn, I watched a small girl with her mother was literally dancing bare foot on the muddy side of the road, hopping on the pot holes, holding her maa's torn pallu and singing loudly , making different types of funny faces, drenched completely. She was the epitome of full bloom lotus, the diva of unending joy, the deity of bliss. And there I was, who was a brand shop from top to toe, materially very very rich as compared to that lovely doll buy still was a mere  pauper considering her happiness and blissfulness. The message was clear to me and I do believe that God Himself arranged that 10 minute long live clip just for me. Soon, like the rain washed all my negativity, I parked my car and jumped out of my car, drenched myself. I was crying, yelling , weeping all wiered emotions in unison. I reached that girl and did best for her, what I could. Touched her and her mom's feet and drove to my home. Couldnt take my little Guru's pic!! The nigattu was no nigattu any more. \n",

But all mothers do that for their kids, right? Well yes, but my mother had to play multiple roles in my house being the only female adult in my house. We always had decent ancestral property but still were financially weak because my father wa struggling with his career choices back then. That's when my mother took to teaching and I am proud son when I say she will be retiring after 2 years as a principal. Since my dad was struggling with his income and my mother took up the job only because she wanted to give us good education. Had she remained a housewife, we would have still survived but could not thought of the education we got. I am an MBA from one of the best B-schools in India, Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies and my sister is a graduate from one of the best design colleges in India, National Institute of Fashion Technology. All of this was made possible because my mother decided to do something in those uncertain times. Not just that, she donned the roles of a dishwasher, a laundry person, a cook and what not in a household which believed all the chores of a regular household are a female's responsibility. My grandfather lost his wife quite early in his life when my dad was a small child, and my mother had to take care of everything. She also had to play motherly figures to my dad's cousins as the age gap was quite big, and it was when my mother herself was in her early twenties and my dad's cousins ages ranged from 6 to 15 years (they were 7 in total). In my growing up years, I have always taken for granted what she has done for all of us. It gives me a lump in my throat now that I think about it. If there is one person whose thought inspires me in the lowest of phases, it is my mother. The way she has uplifted everyone's life she has touched, is just amazing. She is my superhero!",

She not only completed her studies in Home  Science but also facilitated her siblings to complete their education , facilitated  her mother in getting all of them married and decided to devote her life with her mother by remaining single and looking after her as she used to keep unwell . This apart for the last 40 years she has been dedicated volunteer at the Govt hospital spending quality time to look after the patients by arranging medicines, blood and meals for them and their relatives free of cost by soliciting support from relatives and friends,  failing which from her savings & pension to fulfill her philanthropic passion of serving humanity . Keeping nothing for herself she did charity along with her mother to donate clothes and medical equipment may not necessarily be of high value to hospital  and her college.She went a step further to rescue any known or unknown in distress which set an example in a small town Udaipur in Rajasthan where Premlata has been bestowed with  several prestigious awards and citations .\r\nI personally feel that the sacrifice made by her from any early age in supporting her family , mother and public at large inspite of she now being over 70 years is not only a inspirational story but a reality which people only dream but never execute These are rare dedicated lot in unknown quarters not seeking publicity or reward but passion to work relentlessly to pay back to the society.

Sometimes, small things leads to transformation.\nAmishi is a friend, philosopher and guide.\nFew people can be your friends, very few can be philosophers and handful of them can guide you on the right path. She is the best person you can have as a friend and guide and she has her own philosophy. Though she is my senior at workplace, she has always comforted me. She has inspired me to do what I want and not what is right in the eyes of society. She carries a smile wherever she goes. She has inspired me to a new way of life where it is okay to make mistakes, where it is fine to cry, where it is still not too late to start afresh. She is someone who strongly believes in herself and expects the same from others. Her ideology is simple..if you are confident in what you are doing..nothing can stop you.\nShe is outspoken and yet humble..\nSophisticated and yet simple..\nLogical and yet emotional..\nA beautiful heart will always inspire you and she posseses one. \n",

And like the guiding light the women in my life have always empowered me. While my mother has made what I am today, my sister made me realize how wonderfully a women fosters all relationship keeping two families in sync. Then when I got married, my soulmate unveiled a new chapter in my life and taught me to let it go. But this has all been an ongoing process and when I think of a single fable of a lady which inspired me, I remember one incident.\n\nIn my last company, my senior was a female and a very hardworking one. One day we had a professional event in our office and she was down with high fever from the previous day itself. I know how hard it is to work when your body straight away declines to work in harmony with you. So irritation, lethargy and lack of enthusiasm is quite obvious but ironically she was up with full force. Nobody outside our workstation came to know that she was not keeping well. Above that, she could have left early on the previous day and even on the day of the event but she did not do so. She somehow embossed her determination on me and this incident would be etched in my mind forever. \n\n\nWomen have a superpower within them. They are like the sun that never fails to brighten our morning whatever the odds maybe, sometimes it may not even be visible but its light always festoon our lives with affirmation.\n\n",

Gynaecologist by profession got married and later divorced just because she could not bear kids but never revealed the reason was not her. Bravely heading forward in battlefield of life got married again to a father of two where nobody was adjusting but she used to go to her job,prepare meals, wash clothes and all with immense patience. Still life was hard but she was harder. She went to complete her M.D. at the age of 47 and life instead of getting easier got tougher as she started getting transfers to far off places. This woman of gold learnt to drive at the age of 50. One fine day when at tough terrain she handed over the car to the driver the driver after a few minutes list control and the car went rolling into a deep gorge around 1500 feet down. She came out of the car ,the car caught fire but she left no chance of taking the driver out till some villagers came and pulled her apart. Walked uphill on her feet with blood all around. There are certain other incidents too. Her life has always been taking her exams but seeing her tells how to say c'mon! bring it. I am not afraid. She motivates me how to be always be happy no matter even if you are sitting on the volcano of worries. I have learnt that how to spread positivity even after getting all negative in life. Moreover she has also taught to be loving and polite. She is a gem who has taught me how to shine in the darkest spheres of life. Yes, she is my true inspiration, my true motivator and above all my mentor. ",

My mother has done all three - even when I know for a fact that she didn’t have the means. Let me give you a glimpse of my childhood. I belong to an average family of 5 where worked in a clerical post at a bank and was the bread earner as the world says. My mother who’s more qualified(educationally,  has interpersonal skills better by a huge margin, and is triple as hardworking if I’m not understating) was banished from working by my father. Well, such is our society. So she started stitching clothes to give us certain luxuries our father wouldn’t be able to afford (since he was managing the house). She would work so hard for a suit that she charged Rs. 30 for. Put milk and besan on her face because she didn’t get any money for a face pack while all the other women from the same social stature did. We grew up and as her children started supporting her, she started to jump at every opportunity that she got - be it the multilevel marketing structure certain companies like oriflame, Tupperware followed where they needed local agents or be it being a post office account sales manager. She has never looked down at any work and had embraced every opportunity she had got(even with her age - she’s turning 65 soon) God knows I have never met a more hardworking woman in my 26 years of existence. And our pride only grows when we see her getting recognised for her work - she was given the best manager award at wonderchef’s national conference at Hyderabad this May. She’s an inspiration for all her friends and for her children. If only we could take 10% of her strength, motivation and way of looking at life. ",

What I like about her that she herself belongs from azadpur which not a developed area and she stopped taking money from her parents when she was in class 7th. She studied in govt. School of delhi but even then she is passionate for kids. Now she has registered herself as an ngo in the month of may 2019, and she us reaching to more kids. She is trying to work on all the domains which are really important for an individual. She stands up when needed in police station at night , she goes to hospital , she rescued and counselled a child having sexual harassment in her own home. There are many ups and downs in her life in this journey but she never stopped. She hardly stays at home for any festival or on any off .",

From taking a single work trips to Canada and USA thrice from keeping her family the top priority of her life, she keeps me inspiring every day and every second of my life. From taking care of her parents much better than 10 sons can do, to loving my family as much as she does her. From correcting me , Everytime I go wrong in my life, to protecting me from any obstacle coming my way, she motivates me and make me a better man every day. From inspiring helps of the house to teach their kids, to herself teaching our 20 months old son little little things of life, she inspires me. Nikita is a true friend and a human with a heart of genuiness. This world would be much better place to live if we see a little reflection of Nikita in every human being. Cheers to the womanhood in her! ",

She not only taught us how to live life happily (me and my two siblings) but also how to keep the world around us happy. She taught us  all lessons of life, but never even made us realize her sacrifices. Though being left out alone at home, with three of us out of our small home town due to lack of opportunities, she never make us feel that she is alone but rather wants us to spread our wings and fly high. From teaching 6-8 students in need at our home for free to always being the most active member of any social activity in our town ( Guna) she not only inspires me but many. She donates food at the railway station to the ones in need, she goes to old age homes and Aangan Badist to donate needful things , She provides water tanks to sabji waalas in the scrouching summer and yet make a balance of loving her husband, kids and grand kid. She runs a boutique at home just to keep herself busy and in the process help her husband run the family nicely! She is a true inspiration not only to me but to several other women who are not that lucky by the gift of life.  She is a forever inspiration to me ❤️.",

My best memorance as mentioned below: Chanakyapuri was an affluent area that included the Parliament building, foreign embassies, and the residences of the Prime Minister and the President. The crimes in the area were mainly limited to minor thefts, but political demonstrations (which sometimes turned violent) were a regular occurrence. During the 1970s, there were many clashes between Nirankari and Akali Sikhs. On 15 November 1978, a group of Nirankaris held a congregation near India Gate. A contingent of 700–800 Akalis organized a demonstration against them. DCP Bedi's platoon was deployed to stop the protesters and prevent violence. As the protesters resorted to brick-batting, Bedi charged them with a cane, although there was no tear gas squad to support her unit. One of the demonstrators ran towards her with a naked sword, but she charged him as well as other demonstrators with a cane. Ultimately, her unit was able to disperse the demonstrators. For this action, Bedi was awarded the President's Police Medal for Gallantry (1979), in October 1980.",

She truly mapped out the road for several women to follow her path of serving the country as a police officer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiran Bedi introduced many reforms in the Indian prisons to show the right direction of life to hardened criminals. She introduced yoga and meditation to soothe the tensed nerves of the prisoners and make them peaceful. Although she suffered many setbacks in life, she never accepted defeat. Kiran Bedi was transferred from one place to another under pressure of those ones, who were unable to digest her popularity and success, but Kiran Bedi stood her ground and accepted this punishment in her stride although no fault of hers. She stoically faced numerous challenges of life and undertook herculean tasks with great determination and willpower\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAmongst other accolades Kiran Bedi also won an Asia Region Award for prevention of drugs and after that was honoured with the Magsaysay award in the year 1994. Even after retirement, Bedi established the Navjyoti Delhi Police Foundation which helps house homeless people, drug addicts and provides education for slum kids in India. Apart from this, she is known to be a part of several movements including the Anti-Corruption movement in 2010.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHer journey from a pretty tennis player to the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry has been truly commendable- a story legends are made of! In this month of India’s Independence, I salute Kiran Bedi, the prestige and pride of our nation! She will forever be my inspiration.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "My parents are nothing short of role models for both me and my sister, who have got undivided and unfailing love from them, no matter the circumstances. However, the onus of us growing into mature, somewhat worthy and confident humans goes to our mother. Being an Army wife, she has handled our various homes and us, almost alone.  Every place that my dad got posted to, she turned the house we were alloted into our home.  No matter where my dad was posted in,  how many occasions he missed with us or how many holidays we spent at our grandmothers place without him;  the one thing that was constantly provided us with, was extra care and love from our mom. While my dad was (and still is)  serving the nation,  she was (and still is)  taking care of everything. Even while dealing with us strictly, her care for us, showed up in those scoldings too. To narrow it down to one quality in her that I admire, wouldn't be fair enough to attribute to the meanings she has brought in our lives. She has made our life (me and my sister) complete, and that's what we admire the most in her - she being the person that she is. She has shown us in endless situations that standing up for yourself is important, no matter if the world is against you. Hence, I'll always treasure her and her values; for what she taught me is going to help me be the individual I aspire to be. ",

        "description": "This story starts with a flashback. I would have been four or five years old. In Kerala, back then, during temple festivals,playing movies on God was a pattern.As children we used to look forward to it. At night my grandmother would take all three grandchildren of her's to the temple ground and we would sit next to her in the crowded ground and watch movies with our eyes fixated on the screen. It was during one nights in a temple that I saw this small kid in the form of Lord Murugan(Karthikeyan) with big beautiful eyes, Godly face and did everything impossible for a child. I was a fan since our first meeting. Sridevi,  has been a part of my life since then.She means more than an actress to me.Both my parents loved her too. So whenever a movie of her's played in Doordarshan on Sunday evenings, my mom would take me to the nearby home (since we didnot have a TV then). I sat and watch Sridevi, sing, dance, make faces and shift forms in the blink of your eyes.\nSridevi became a source of happiness to me, without me even realising it. She kept the fun factor in my life alive. Women never felt like the oppressed gender when I watched her. She was always the mighty one. She could fight, do double and triple roles, do wits, hit the villain, be the boss, challenge the hero and even become a celestial being! I believed that all women could that. In Chalbaaz when she says, I am just a woman who is trying to make my mark in this male dominated world, blood gushed into my brains.!An industry where the face of actresses kept on changing and heroes remained forever, I saw her with father and son! Even in the presence of the biggest of stars she stood tall.\nI was an addicted fan,  is and will always be. Even in her goodbye to this mortal world, she taught me how life is unpredictable and when here,be the reason for someone else's happiness and live life like a star! ",

This is the woman with passion for her duties. She is the only teacher in her school. Because of her efforts only children the her village don't go to private schools. They love her a lot and ready to come to school in vacation too. They are the only children I know who don't like holidays.

She used to work earlier and at that time too she managed all the things very well. Standing from morning to night, engrossed in work, she inspires me to be like her. A girl has to sacrifice much after her marriage and even after those sacrifices, which include leaving her parents and owing somebody else's parents, what she asks for is only love and care. A highly understanding wife, who adjusted herself so well and accepted all the new family members as her own family members is because of having great values in upbringing since childhood. Accepting old age family members and taking care of them in today's scenario is very rare but I am lucky to have her in my life for an inspiration to lead my life with love and affection.",

She has made so many compromises in her life so that the other person should be happy .\nAs my father is a surgeon so basically he used to get posted to other states of India or abroad.\nBut my mom shed her tears only once when my father was leaving as he wanted that me and my mom should have a great living. \nMy mom she raised me single handedly, acting as both parent.\nShe is bold enough and independent.\nShe has powerful wings which are spreaded to bring happiness in my life.\nWhen i am alone i think of her, how she has lived her life just having me in her life, so i have the courage to fight back.\nIf i am independent in my life its just because of my mom.\nBeing independent is a great thing for all of us, but only some have the courage of staying independent.\nShe taught me how to spread my wings of happiness and to fight like a warrior when the world is against you.\nWhat i admire about my mom is her smile, its like the morning sunrise wherein everyone wishes to be able to see the sun against all the odds which are happening i life.\nShe has helped a baby turn into a toddler then a kid then a teenage and then into an adult, where she saw so many obstacles but she knew that we just need to break the hurdles and to get stuck.\nIts very difficult for a new born mom to raise her baby wherein she has no support but in times its just that she knows that she is the whole world for her baby.\nShe told me that woman should be financially independent in their life and to be able to stand and walk with their head straight. \nThe world can't to anything to a strong woman.\nSo thank you mom for making me independent and strong and to be carefree.",

Unfortunately ,my life took an unexpected turn 4 years back . I lost my father due to a sudden heart attack. My mother was a pampered wife throughout , she never faced the harsh realities of life as my father always shadowed her with utmost love. After his demise , she fixed her broken soul for us . She gathered the courage to start working as a teacher at the age of 48 regardless of any teaching experience in her entire life because she use to be a home maker. As , my family lives in a small town , people made all sort of comments to let her feel down. Nonetheless ,she stood like a pillar of strength for us. Now she is managing her work life , looking after home and playing the role of mother as well as father to us. \nShe is a source of inspiration for me to take on every challenge of life with undying spirit and that woman are capable of achieving everything . I hope that God gives enough strength to her that she never feels alone and I as her daughter make her a proud mother at each step of her life.\n",

I don't know whether i will win this contest or not but i have already won this contest by a colossal margin just by writing about my hero and inspiration,my dear wife...\nWe both are doctors,but she sacrificed her career and practice to back me and to take care of the familial well being by standing like a pillar of support. she takes care of each and everything at home and makes it sure i don’t get even a drop of stress and helps me to concentrate on my professional demands and excellence. She makes all the notes for my lectures,for my conferences,for my courses with all smiling faces..Today i am one of the best lifestyle experts of india and i owe all my success to my hero-my wife-my inspiration.The inspirational story doesn't end here,she as a mother is thoroughly unmatchable. She stays with my son 24*7 and you will be surprised to know she is the best friend of my son.Yes,the key reason for that is the systems she has made at home-1.no whatsapp 2.no facebook 3.no phone usage till 12th grade.4.internet only for educational purposes.5.even my phone does not have a whatsapp.Well my son has no problems with all these system,just because she keeps him occupied with lot of activities and spends all the quality time with him so that he doesn't get addicted to all these “new age addictive technologies and gadgets” which are leading to series family crisis and health issues all over the world. She is not only the hero for me,she is the hero for my son too...she always inspired me to work hard and today she stands synonymous to-*dedication*hard work*giving back*systemic living*never ending love*unconditional care*superior humanity and yes,”THE WOW WOMEN” who is an example to millions of woman in this nation..“celebrating her is actually celebrating my life” because she makes my everyday a celebration.. my hero-my wife-my inspiration...",

No matter what path was ahead my mother moved headstrong.\r\nShe did not fear the obstacles but met them with grace and elegance not once letting her guard down or giving way to a crack that may have caused a fracture. She is formidable and fearless. \r\nDuring my stormy adolescent n youth she stood by me like a rock filled with the Spirit of God. She taught me to discern what would be a better choice reasoning out my every query, setting clear examples. \r\nHer knowledge is vast and she is totally aware of many a subject....\r\nToday as I also play a similar role ,I look back at the sacrifice she made every single day,  the trouble she went through to protect her Cubs like the fearless Lioness. ...\r\nShe is the earth that binds everything together, like the walls of a house are kept together by what binds them. ...Her compassion keeps me going on every difficult day....\r\nShe is my role model ,my everything....\r\nAnd more I was surprised one day, when both my Cubs said to me that they want to be like HER,MY MOTHER, when they grow up....so thus I know that she encompasses everything and is the epitome of a well balanced and fulfilled life.\r\nHER CHILDREN RISE UP AND CALL HER HAPPY,HER HUSBAND TOO AND HE PRAISES HER.\r\n( Prov.31:28)",

She has not given birth to a child, because she is the mother of the mankind, unlike her counterparts who crave for a child, as if not brearing a child is the greatest sin on earth. Holy Mother’, Sri Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna, was born on 22 December 1853 in a poor Brahmin family in Jayrambati, a village adjoining Kamarpukur in West Bengal. She epitomizes how to lead a spiritual life while discharging household duties.

When people who know her feel low in life, they think of her and get an instant shot of inspiration. The relief and peace that a religious baba cant provide, she can do that easily provide that through her outlook towards life. Married to once a rich family in a small town of India, Bulbul has kept her family strong during her husband's bankruptcy, did not let the male-dominated society take away her second child away from her, has fought and won 2 battles of cancer - ovarian and breast, has not let her left-side paralysis stop her from standing tall, so what if a negligence by the surgeon during her cancer surgery may have cost her another couple of surgeries - one of them a major plastic surgery, life has given her multiple fractures and surgeries on her hands and legs but that doesn't stop her from going for her evening walk. Doctors say she is a moving miracle, people like me who know her call her the ultimate inspiration - the ever-smiling sunflower of our lives. She is the hope, the beacon that brightens our life. She inspires us to live in the present and never fret about life. She reminds us of how fortunate we are and why we should be grateful to God every single day. She is someone whose story should reach out to people who are depressed, under duress, or those who are just not satisfied with their lives.\n\n1) Mental strength can win over any disease. Look at Bulbul\n2) You are always better off than millions of people around. Look at Bulbul\n3) Happiness is more a temperament rather than circumstance. If you think you are unlucky, think about Bulbul\n4) Whatever be the situation, you can always chose to be happy. Look at Bulbul\n5) Financial distress? Depression? Feeling Hopeless? Medically Unfit? Unhappy? Unlucky? Look at Bulbul\nAnd many many many other things to look at and learn from Bulbul.",

She can succeed in the first ones by being loving and thankful but being a good wife requires more than just love. She needs to be caring, devoted, and trustworthy to keep her family whole.\n\nThis is where my wife comes in. Being a wife looks easy, but it is not. Being married to the man of your dreams brings lots of joys. It is the beginning of a new life for the women. There are lots of challenges to be faced and responsibilities to be fulfilled. She handles each with much ease.\n\nHere is where understanding each other’s wants, needs and expectations take centre stage. Ultimately,  a good wife begets a good husband and vice versa.",

If good happens enjoy and if bad happens learn from them. 1 % things are beyond your control and you can’t do anything about it like natural calamities, death of your near ones etc. Only you can respond to such situations with all the courage stored in you with no place for fear.

For her, police stood for power to correct instead of power to punish and believed in equal policing despite of all men around her. It was first and the last time when the Prime Minister of India was given a parking ticket. She denied self-glorification by refusing Asian Jyoti award as it was not for her whole traffic unit. The rule was simple-pro justice because of which she was sent to indiscreet postings where others would say ‘No’. She was sent to prison assignment a den of criminals-10000 men to 400 women to lock her thinking as there will be no car and no parking tickets to vips or ministers. She never complained about anything what was left over by the officers earlier in Tihar jail or in other postings of her.

Everytime, she could not clear, she never got disappointed rather brought in her the zeal to do more. Where others became hopeless and left the course, she opted to fight back each time with more courage and rigourous practice. She never skipped an attempt. And, finally hard work paid off.

        "description": "My inspiration is my mother, it seems very obvious that a child to be inspired by his mother. My father was in BSF and my mother was a single working parent for me and my sister. She started working as a teacher in the year 1992 in Jodhpur, and it was the time when there was a mental illness in our society of a small city like Jodhpur that a woman can not work, she is born to serve his husband and in-laws but with the support of my father, she has gone against society and started working as a teacher.\r\nIn the present time, culture has arrived that the husband and wife both are working and they do not have time for their children. Children are getting older at the creche with learning from their nannies and I still remember the time when my mother woke up at 5am to prepare breakfast and lunch for her children, then she drops us to school and gives everyday same instructions till the age of 14 that do not fight with anyone or do not do anything wrong so that anyone in family gets a chance to blame my mother that due to her wish of being teacher her children are making a nuisance. That time I and my sister were always in thinking that our mother is so strict and put lots of restrictions to us but now is the time when I really respect her a lot and I am proud to my mother that due to her courage only we are having a life which we were not even can dream about.",

I always tell my mom that why you are not taking a One Week leave from the job so we could travel and feel relax with each other. But she always telling if I won't earn who will see your education and material expenses. She Works whole day from 8:30 AM to 7:30 PM and even she don't take a rest. She sometimes tired, I am seeing it but she always makes her happy and try to glam her face every time. How!!! I don't understand. She always do her work and tell me to give head massage and sometimes she got angry that Seth(Boss) is satisfied with his work and always try to out from the situation so she could satisfy. I always learn from her that how she makes the budget and control the household expenditure. And ask me to prevent unwanted expenses and tell me to do this things so you could attend the success to control the expenses. And give me the authority in every way so any mistake I had done so she try to explain me that you shouldn't do this and try to avoid in every way.\r\nThank you Yes Bank.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "She is a child of a God and i believed when i see her struggling everyday with respect to financial issues but never loose hope or faith on God. She was a computer teacher in an esteemed school but when it came to fulfilling her responsibilities she dropped teaching just to raise me and my elder sister. Things got worse when my nani expired. We had financial issues so she decided to take tuitions at home and be the best homemaker too. There were issues in her married life which led to suicide attempts but she was a fighter and she is surviving only to teach us how to make a respected living in this very challenging society. She had lost all her educational documents meanwhile so she could not continue teaching in any school due to absence of proof and from that day the pinch in her heart allowed me to understand the need and importance of education. My elder sister could not complete her CS finals and to reach till that stage she took almost 9 attempts meanwhile i started my CA and got the degree in 2019 after struggling with 6 attempts. So my mother took 15 attempts to not only provide us the much required degree but all her patience, struggle, endurance, faith, hardwork, prayers, sacrifice paid off with the message of how much a degree can provide you with! Even we fall she is standing beside us only to give us her helping hand till the last breathe of her life. She is an inspirational legend unnoticed to entire world but who is a world for me undoubtedly. The way she has so much in her that even at the age of 51 she dreams of opening an institute of her own, teaching me the importance of healthy lifestyle, good eating habits, saving of wealth is truely beyond imagination. God bless such inspirations ",

I will narrate just one incident to illustrate my point. Once on board a flight from Kolkata to Guwahati, a young lady who was sitting next to my wife suddenly fell fell critically ill. Before my wife realized what was happening, the lady, who was a cardiac patient and was already beginning to lose consciousness, fell on my wife's lap. We  immediately called for help from the flight attendants. Together we poured some water onto her face, and as luck would have it, she regained her consciousness. My wife then massaged her head and forehead and asked her if she would like to eat something. My wife fed her Maggie that we purchased for ourselves. After eating, she felt somewhat better. My wife kept on massaging her head for the entire duration of the remaining part of the journey. At Guwahati Airport we finally handed over the young lady to her father who was \n waiting for her. Had it not been for my wife's unrelenting care, and love and attention, we do not know what could have happened. Three cheers and Kudos to my dear Madhumita!!! We all need people like you around us.

        "description": "My mother, Mrs Tirumala is my role model. She inspires and motivates me to grow without any barriers.\r\n  \r\nMy mother supported me in every part of my life. Right from childhood she has been with me like my shadow. It had been riddled with hurdles and difficulties, but she has managed to cross them with her love and care.\r\n\r\nBasically we are from a middle class family and father is a private employee and we are total four including my sister. So my mother also had to handle our home life. So she started tailoring to help my father. That is how she was able to satisfy financial needs in the home. There are certain days where we couldn’t eat food for three times a day still she never make us to starve. When I was studying my engineering there was a time where my friends going for an excursion and I couldn’t afford money even though my mother gave money to go with my friends without hesitating. By this I learnt “Time is precious than wealth”. Because if my mother say no I would have missed those days with my friends and I really won’t get those days back even I have enough money now. She gave everything in my life what she didn’t get from her childhood. It’s her dream to see her children to be happy and achieve what they need. I feel she achieved it.  \r\n\r\nNow I've graduated in B.Tech (ECE) and I’m working as software engineer.\r\n\r\nWhenever I look at my mother I see an ordinary person but when I think about what she does and how she does it she becomes divine and the reason of my smile! \r\n\r\nThe experience of my life so far has truly brought things into perspective. My mother has taught me that hard times can be overcome and that losing battles can be won. She has taught me more than I could have learnt from any book. \r\n\r\nShe sets an inspirational example to me teaching me how to live life and make make wise decision even in the most uncertain situations. I respect her a lot. She is my inspiration and I feel everyone should have a mother like my mother. Love you Amma!!",

        "description": "n 2013, Manisha Soin started a platform called ihealthkonnect- India's 1st price discovery platform for healthcare where one could discover and compare prices for medical procedures, surgeries, cost of medical treatment from some of the best hospitals in India. At ihealthkonnect , her mission was to improve access to healthcare. She believe that healthcare was made for everyone since the pain point for most people was the lack of awareness of local and global options. Ihealthkonnect aimed to ease that by collaborating with the best hospitals across geographies to give you indicative price points for cost of one's medical treatment. As an easy to use platform, patients were able to search, consult, compare and book their treatment at an affordable cost at some of the very best , trusted, JCI accredited hospitals in India. However, this made her realise that Cancer Treatments were of high cost and were the most popular searches on the website. On talking to a few patients, she also realised that most patients were unsure of their cancer treatment plans and sought validation . Hence, in early 2019, she co-founded CanceRX- a platform that is working on the painpoint of affordability for cancer care. CanceRX offers patients affordable consults, 2nd opinions, affordable diagnostics, and affordable care delivery for cancer treatments- synonymous to her mission with ihealthkonnect. Over the past year, Cancerx has an internal tumour board, has 230 oncologists on board and has grown from being a patient front platform only to a platform where even doctors at the point of contact can query with peers, other super specialist oncologists on cancer cases, helping with earlier detection, diagnosis thereby improving prognosis. E- prescription, and tie-ups with pharma companies ensure drug delivery at a reduced cost even at remote locations. On a personal level, Manisha lives with her family in Gurgaon and loves all things fitness like swimming and gymming. She is also a foodie.",

Not just that, she made me realise how important is it to keep your friends together when they are fighting and when everyone is mean to each other. I have seen her solving problems by just hugging people and talking. I have always believed in talking to the person directly to solve the issue rather than talking behind the back. I was lucky enough to find myself in her. She is just like me (for this part at least). We had our share of ups and down and she was the one who came and talk to me to figure out what can be done to solve the issue without affecting our friendship. Next time when we fought (on something else), I thought about her ...what would she had done if she were in my place? The answer was straight forward..I went to her and talked to her. Since then we do this juggling where sometimes I go and talk to her or sometimes she come and talks to me. Sometimes we AGREE to DISAGREE (which I feel is a very important part of any friendship or relationship). Not just this, we talk about studies as well. We try to understand each other's work and give ideas about how to tackle any problem or how to make it better. She has taught me that it doesn't matter whether you belong to same field or not, it is all about are you willing to help the other person and learn from the other person at the same time. She made me believe that friendship is not just about hanging out, drinking together, making fun of ther people, rather its is also about growing together, point out other person's mistake (in a positive way), learning togther and teavhing each other about how to be a part of your own and the other person's overall development. According to me, this is the best quality which make you respect and love other person. ",

She is such a kind hearted women who loves unconditionally, who will help without any purpose , always happy and doesn't allow any kind of stress or problem come near her.\nShe spreads her positivity every where she goes. \nJust a lil instance I would like to share.\nOnce while walking down the road she saw a young boy pulling rickshaw with a wounded foot.. Not knowing anything about him,she took him to a doctor. Doctor said that the boy was suffering from absis, wherein the foot becomes purple and it pains alot and that this will need a long treatment, with weekly visit to the doctor. Here I woul like to tell you that the consultatiin fees of the doctor was 800 and medicine that were prescribed were for 2400 .. In today's time who would spend so much on a stranger.. ?? May I add here that not only this lady took care of his medicines for 3 months but also his weekly visit to the doctor but also provide him 2 meals daily.. Hatss off to her. She is an inspiration to me. She is my mother . I live her alot and more than that I respect her alot. ",

For Chinni Swamy, it really did, when she started her initiative Stree Shakti with one woman at her own home in village Purkal, in Uttaranchal.\n\nIt was back in 2001, when Chinni and her husband Swamy thought of moving ‘to some place in the foothills of Himalayas’. For most people that would mean a charming town like Dehradun or the picturesque hill station of Mussoorie. The Swamys chose a little village, Purkal, which falls somewhere between Dehradun and Mussoorie.\n\nOnce there, Swamy started a school for children from nearby villages and Chinni decided to introduce the women of those villages to a little known craft form - quilting. Slowly, over the years, Chinni has introduced the world to these quilts through her entrepreneurial venture, 'Stree Shakti'.\nWhat started with one woman then, has grown into a team of over 130 today. This includes the women who make the products, the designers, accounts manager, purchase and marketing manager, store manager, office assistant, supervisor, quality controller and trainers.\n\nStree Shakti retails its products through their shop at the women centre in Purkal, their online store and at exhibitions across the country. They also have retail partners in the US and the UK.",

        "description": "I am a Yoga expert, Reiki Grand Master, a young Entrepreneur. It wasn’t an easy way choosing my profession as a yoga teacher!\r\nIt was that time when my results of the final year of college ( Bachelors in History .)  in June 2008 were out and I was hit by some chemical reactions in my brains. Some doctors even refused to write the diagnosis on the paper. I was not in my normal consciousness for 4 weeks. I was getting hallucinations and I went into my own imaginary world. By the time I got back to my normal self, my family told me that I was unwell for quite a long time. My treatment had started and I was told that I was affected by some type of serious depression. It took me around a year and a half to get back to my normal life again and meanwhile I had gained 25 kgs as a result of the side effects of the medicines. I had stopped seeing myself in the mirror as I refused to accept the person I had become.\r\nFor me, my life had come to an end and I saw no ray of hope. What saddened me the most was that some of my school friends spread rumors that I had become mad or faced some mental craziness. They not just made fun of me but made fun of my illness.\r\nI was trying really hard to come out of that safe shell I had created for myself where I avoided talking to people, going out of my home and was hell scared of driving.\r\nA person who had been a topper in her academics in college, won competitions in dance or music performances, a professional Jazz dancer, her life had come to a Halt. But I didn’t give up on life and I fought back!\r\nI started practicing Positive affirmations for my health, I resumed back to my yoga practice after taking permission from my doctor. Yoga helped me in the reduction of my medicine dosage and gradually it pulled me out of depression! Today I run a yoga school and run a brand for corporate yoga Pan delhi ncr and I train yoga teachers with International certification. My story has been featured on abp news tv in 2017 on 21st June. \r\n",

Being someone who hails from a very small town from Rajasthan, Tonk, I was always wanted to do something for the people who are not privileged and don't have access to right advice and knowledge to break the barriers. I learned most of the things on my own via internet. So, I decided to give it back to my society. When I was pregnant and have to asked to leave the office (yes, my organisation didn't had concept of maternity leaves and I was forced to take unpaid leave). I decided to utilize my time to do something impactful and here I conceived the idea of helping the unprivileged people to learn the computer. I wanted to do it for masses, so I started working on an app idea (being an software engineer, it was my forte), I conceptualized a simple app to learn computer and internet, how to use the computer and internet. From where to get access to the infinite source of knowledge and do something big. I developed and launched this app when I was pregnant, created quality content to learn computer in Hindi and today, my app stand at 2 million installs. 20 lacs people have learned basic computer and how to use internet in simple hindi using my app. I keep receiving a lot of user feedback which are filled with love and emotions as these are the people about which no one is thinking as these the poor people and can't afford expensive courses. So, it feels really great when I see my own hardships and despite those I never gave up and build something which is helping millions now to break the chains and come out stronger where they can follow their own dreams.",

She was a computer teacher in an esteemed school but when it came to fulfilling her responsibilities she dropped teaching just to raise me and my elder sister. Things got worse when my nani expired. We had financial issues so she decided to take tuitions at home and be the best homemaker too. There were issues in her married life which led to suicide attempts but she was a fighter and she is surviving only to teach us how to make a respected living in this very challenging society. She had lost all her educational documents meanwhile so she could not continue teaching in any school due to absence of proof and from that day the pinch in her heart allowed me to understand the need and importance of education. My elder sister could not complete her CS finals and to reach till that stage she took almost 9 attempts meanwhile I started my CA and got the degree in 2019 after struggling with 6 attempts. So my mother took 15 attempts to not only provide us the much required degree and respect but all her patience, struggle, endurance, faith, hardwork, prayers, sacrifice paid off with the message of how much a degree can provide you with! Whenever we fall she is standing beside us only to give us her helping hand till the last breathe of her life. She is an inspirational legend unnoticed to entire world but who is a world for me undoubtedly. The way she has so much in her that even at the age of 51 she dreams of opening an institute of her own, teaching me the importance of healthy lifestyle, good eating habits, saving of wealth is truly beyond imagination.

I used to fair badly in maths and would be ever frighten to show my progress report every quarter for signature. I was a hard worker but not a smart worker. I slogged and slogged and finally came with a high score in the Anglo Indian boards. I decided then that I want to be a Banker. This was very much my Father's wish also. Wrote all Banking Exams, Govt. Job exams along with my college studies. Finally in 1991 I joined ANZ Grindlays Bank. Within 6 months from Chandni chow branch to Greater Kailash branch I got a transfer. Worked smartly with a lots of performance applauds for a continues 9 years at the same branch. Finally took ERS (early separation) then joined Indusind Bank in the same year and from AM level went up to CM level  within 7.5 years. And handled various ISO and RBI Audits. Finally left in 2013 due to health issues. But today I have a great content and a satisfied life. Enjoying on all that I left out during my tight schedule day's. I am an inspiration for myself. Because contentment, self satisfaction and motivation that we have ONLY ONE LIFE live it to the FULLEST. ",

Living in a household just us girls has brought us together and made the bond between us very strong. My parents have always taught me and my sister that family always comes first and that is something that has always stuck with me. Even though my father and his side of the family live in different state both of my parents have made an effort to keep our family very close and connected as a unit. That is something that I love and appreciate and even being miles away from my father I still feel as though I can go to him with anything. Beyond my immediate family, I have 8 cousins and I have a great, really close relationship with every one of them. My entire family from both from my mom and dad's side spend Christmas, thanksgiving and other big holidays together. This is something that I hope to continue as a tradition for many, many years.",

Babita is the founder of Riya Chemy which is a 20 year old chemical manufacturing company having several brands catering to construction chemicals, home care, automobile detailing & instant glue adhesive industry.\nWhat inspires me about her is that she ventured into a business where there has been hard-hitting competition from multinational companies since the beginning but her determination to provide excellent quality products for the mass market made her a winner & is standing strong with these competitors since 1999.\nApart from taking care of manufacturing, she also had to market & deliver these products in the retail during the beginning, even during her prenatal period.\nBeing a lady, she never let any flaws overcome her. She implemented & overpowered every obstacle & always cared the most for her employees. \nAt a very early stage of business, she understood the needs of being there in the Industry for long & established every necessary facility that a full-fledged company has today. The company was the highest tax payer in the circle during the central excise regime.\nFrom zero to a turn-over of thirty million for a lady who learnt everything in these 20 years, makes her self-made & her mortality that kept everyone along the journey.\nFrom making products manually to semi-automatic machines, a full-fledged lab, an appropriate manufacturing set-up & every law being obeyed, this is her true achievement.\nHer financial discipline is what inspires me too. In the history of twenty years, not a single cheque default by the Company, this is commendable. \nWith no venture capitalists nor any public money involved, Riya Chemy has grown by the support of its banker & the trust built with its suppliers who have been associated since the inception of the Company.\nShe is a true inspiration to me, she has shown me that there is nothing impossible if you have the determination. She believes that people will someday overcome being brand conscious & value quality products.",

Her lessons are the best medication to cure a disease called life failures because she prepares her child for a future struggle with all her guidelines.\nThere is a saying in Hindi “Putra Kuputra ho sakta hain, lekin Mata Kumata nahi ho sakti”. It means “Son can do any worse with Mother, but Mother can never think any wrong about her child” and it’s so truthful.

She always figured out fun ways to get me to clean up my room or brush my teeth . She always knew how to give the right advice. When I was seven, I often came home crying from school, because, back then, I was a bit chubby and my peers ruthlessly picked on me. My mother would hold me in her arms, push back my long hair from my face, and wiped away my tears as I told her what happened. My mother gave the right advice so many times, it was if she had been right there with me when it happened. Being little, I would sometimes whine about my weight, and then my mother would tell me that she had once been like me. \n\nMy mother was the strongest person I have ever known. And if my mother had not been so strong, I do not think I would be here today, telling you her story",

        "description": "By twist of fate I first met Pausali at The Institute of Chartered Accountants  in Kolkata when she was struggling to make her footprints in the professional world.She was very polite,  docile and introvert but rich in values and lots of affection to the needy. Her life-story travels across torrid times when she lost her father at a tender age of 8 yrs, brought up by her mother, a convent school teacher by profession ,single handedly. Her perseverance has helped her pass through the most compelling and difficult circumstances one could have ever imagined during growing up. Her sincerity and determination helped her to come out with flying colours during her schooling at Loreto House  in sports,  culture and academics by winning several accolades and merit certificates. Her struggles in life develop her strengths.  She was a rank holder in Graduation in B.Com (Hons.). Destiny struck her once again when mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. But her indomitable spirit to face and overcome every challenge that life brings in her journey empowered her to pursue her study and complete he post-qualification from Chartered Institute while pursuing her mothers' treatment. Her affirmative and positive attitude continues to  inspire me. She has earned admiration not only from her teachers but also amongst her peers who has seen her steer through amidst all adversities. . She always believes that what you want to achieve is possible if done with good intention and sharing the fruits of achievements . She instills faith and belief in others that you can rise even amongst adversities.  Till date she has overcome every obstacle faced in her life at the same time encouraging others to attain  success. Every obstacle that came across in her life gives her an opportunity to improve her circumstances.  She is also an active volunteer  in social activities  engaging her kind heart, generosity, and willingness to get things done for the underprivileged. ",

Her smile gives me hope that no matter how hard the life gets, it will all be fine. She is fighting it out against cancer but still she never lets us feel that there is anything wrong and manages our home like a pro!! The sacrifices she made in her life just to ensure that our family as a whole prospers is beyond my imagination. I dont know any person stronger than her in my life. Its in these moments like this ‘celebrating her’ campaign that I think and realize how much she matters to me and our family. Love you mom, I hope the smile in your face never fades away :) ",

Little  did I know that this summer was going to change my life forever! I lost my father to pancreatitis, also known as the silent killer. We had no idea he was ill and neither did he! \r\nImagine everything important in your life being taken away without warning, better yet imagine spending your whole life with that person and have it taken away in a matter of days. It was a terrible ordeal for my brother and I. I starkly remember what she had to say that fateful day, who are we to step in to deny what god or fate wants, he’s in better place!\r\nTroubled times did lay ahead with all our relatives asking us to relocate back home and have them support us. But the Iron Lady in my life simple stood tall for us and said we can handle ourselves and you’re damn right she did. Financial troubles and all, she never made it seem like they existed, keeping us protected though I knew they were there. Now that I’ve a job and have asked her to come settle with me,  she simply says that I’m still young and much to experience, why tie you down to responsibilities. It was your fathers and mine to ensure you were settled down in life and I’m going to make sure I complete that. Her down to earth nature, an ever so friendly face and attitude coupled with fierce perseverance and hard work is what that held us together and helped us get through troubled times. She stood tall and made us proud. She’s my Iron Lady. She is my definition of girl power!",

Inspite of being a woman of those times, she had a deep leaning towards knowledge and education. She herself was a botany student from a renowed college in Coimbatore. She aimed for perfection in whatever she did. That made her a class apart from everyone. She was very good in tailiring, drawing, embroidery,and an excellent cook too. She was deeply religious, health conscious  and above all an epitome of sacrifice for the family. She inspired me to do my M. . Phil in Biochemistry . She created that passion in me to learn, share and spread my wings of knowledge. Today when I receive awards for my contributions in the field of Education it is a pity she is not there to see them. Yet her advices and uobringing has paved way for me to achieve in life and also lead my son to be a good human being. Kudos to her love for learning, accumulation of knowledge which in turn has inspired me to be a life long learner. I am glad I have passed on the same to my son,. Thanks Ma for instilling a love for knowledge, duscipkine and above all to care and share theo positive things of life with all. Thank You once for nurturing ne to be an excellent human being. ",

Only me and my mother survived with major injuries. \nWhen everything was falling apart in our life, and I thought, being a student at that time,  we won't be able to survive in this world. But she stood up irrespective of having major surgeries and numerous stitches on head, and joined her job as a school teacher in March. She stood up for me, got me admission in DTU, Delhi in MBA, while I was struggling with my injuries. She stood up for me, she fought everyone for me, the family which was left. She stood strong alone, and in year 2017 she happily retired as a principal of Govt school in Rohini. I can't imagine how she did that, who gave her the power to rise this strong, but she's my everything. She was always there when I felt weak and took all the burden of running the family. We're still not recovered completely but she always stay positive about Life irrespective of challenges after loosing almost everything. Yes, my home is a home because of her with all doors open for relatives and friends. She's my Superstar and she always will be.\nP.S. now all because of her efforts I'm settled after completing my MBA, and I'm sure I'm never lacking motivation and positiveness she gave me. Yes, she's my mother and she's nothing less than a warrior in every aspect.",

I was not sure, as I was in Dubai, working with luxury hotels.\nAnd was on a brink of entering the cruise industry. \nSo this came as a surprise to me, as I was never ready for marriage.\nLuckily I got my dream job and said yes for the marriage. \nAnd there begun our 18 months courtship period, before we got married in Dec, 2016.\n\nEvery girl wants her partner to be with her all the time.\nWe were not lucky in this case due to the nature of my job.\nI always had an impression, that I have abundance of patience but I was horribly wrong, she is a goddess of patience. \nMy work pressure kept on mounting, stressed was rising day by day in my new cruise job and all these frustrations, I used to shower it on my fiancee. She still listened it silently and hanged up, with patience, telling me to go and sleep. Deep down she knew, it was not real me. \nThis frustration builded up like mountain and I was not happy with my job, wanted to quit, but was not in a financial situation to do so. Also I was being paid well, so had to drop the idea. But again she stood and consoled me began to motivate me like 'Sandeep Maheshwari'. But somehow her words were magical and it used to bring positivity in me.\nShe being herself a banker, does everything for my parents to make them happy, even when they are not. 3 years to the marriage and her respect is still same for my parents and still she gives her best. \n'What a wonder women' she is. \nI realised later on what about her own happiness, is she happy and she said 'yes'. Because she loves me and her only goal is to keep me motivated. 'Akansha' I ❤️you",

Either her own dreams of having enjoyement of life or having some personnel space with her husband, she made sacrifices to make sure her childrens wont have a single chance having tough time.I saw her playing the role of a ideal Mother with other critical roles of being a wife of a tough husband and daughter of a cruel mother in law.\r\n\r\nAnd believe you me if jury will give her Oscar for that it will be less. I am not sure from which management college she has aquired management skills( she never told me) which played a important role to create harmony and love within the family members ,irrespective of the fact that she is ILLITERATE.\r\n\r\nIn last all i want to say is Mother is beautiful gift of god may be beacuse God cant be available everywhere,eveytime.",

She was the first women to became IPS officer in the country & she was very strict in a work & never listen to any of political pressure & worked obediently. \nMy concern about this.

And for all the right reasons.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 21, Muniba was left paralyzed from the hip down after surviving a tragic car accident. Her backbone was crushed and she sustained multiple fractures to her arm, shoulder, ribs and collarbone. Doctors told her that she would be unable to walk, paint, or give birth; this left her devastated and questioning her existence in the world.\r\n\r\n“…that day I decided that I’m going to live life for myself. I am not going to be that perfect person for someone. I am just going to take this moment and I will make it perfect for myself, that I’m going to fight my fears.”\r\n\r\nIn her powerful and inspiring speech, Muniba shares coming to terms with her new purpose while being confined to a bed for two years. Nine years later, her inspirational story continues to touch people all over the world. Muniba was named one of BBC’s “100 Most Inspirational Women in 2015” and featured in Forbes’ “30 under 30” the following year.\r\n\r\n“You know, when you end up being on the wheelchair, what’s the most painful thing. People think that they will not be accepted by the people because we in the world perfect people are imperfects. So I decided to appear more in public.”\r\n\r\nHer presence in Pakistan continues to grow as she works as an anchor at Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV). She has also worked on campaigns for Toni&Guy and refuses to portray herself as a victim of circumstance. A firm believer in ‘turning adversity into opportunity’, this 29-year-old has made it her mission to inspire the same in others.\r\n\r\nAs Pakistan’s first wheelchair-using artist and first female Goodwill Ambassador, Muniba continues to model, speak and sing, proving that determination always trumps hardship.",

Short stories, her life experiences pen down in the form of small chapters. Every chapter gives you a reason to be good to others and teaches how to serve others, value of what God has given us and finally share what we have be it materialistic or knowledge. Sharing some of her charity works, sponsoring a girl met in the train, how she stopped drinking milk, stopped buying Sarees, giving good quality rice to people you come begging at your door.something that had a major impact on myself.... Influenced by her work, this year dedicated my summer vacations one month in Banaras and joined a NGO named Aghor Foundation for a month, taught under privileged kids in Anjali school , 6 days a week and on Sunday visited eye-camps. Wonderful experience..... pure, connection, love with kids. Reading Sudha Murthy’s book helped me as a guide what to do in life. Celebrated my late fathers birthday with kids, served food to them and cooked Kheer for 150 kids myself....picture I have shared with little Rohan drinking kheer made by me.... heavenly satisfying feeling..... unconditional love..... promised myself would come to school to do service every year now on..... learnt a lesson, everybody should do little what one can do..... world will surely become heaven.....the way god has made.",

As women lawyers, her journey was so personally inspiring to us. But the truth is we, women, alone cannot claim her. What she represented was so much beyond gender. She truly was what we want our leaders to be, our politics aside.\r\nHer powerful oratorial skills were enhanced not only by her command of the Hindi language, but also by her scholarship in Sanskrit and political science. But mostly, it was enhanced by sheer hard work and her acquired in-depth knowledge of every subject she touched upon.Swaraj carried herself with grace and dignity. Her public life spanned an unblemished four decades. She will remain an inspiration for all young political aspirants that desire change through a mechanism of clean politics.\r\n“All good things come in small packages” is a phrase she epitomised. The image of her standing head and shoulders above ministers from other parts of the world, at the foreign ministers meet, in Beijing, will remain her lasting legacy. It is a matter of pride that the tallest figure of Indian politics came in the form of a woman. A woman who wore her Indianness and femininity, each day and everywhere.",

I think it’s really important to encourage each other. Encourage other women. We have to be joyful warriors. Your Confidence should come from who you are and what you do. Every step that I have taken in my career, I have been fearless. I don’t like giving negativity power. It seems that women is taking over the world. We are moving forward. You know, change is happening. That’s beautiful.\r\n\r\nI believe everyone goes through hardships in life. Some choose to accept and the others like me try to change the world revolving around me. Here is my story, I’ am sure there are lot of people in this world who have faced lot many problems and some are still dying daily from inside.\r\n\r\nMy mother was 6 years old when she lost her mom. She got married at the age of 18. My father is a businessman and wanted a son. I still remember those days when I use to visit my mom after school at a nursing home nearby my place because my father use to beat my mother very badly. Most of the times she use to get injured for no reason. She use to stay quiet and we were too young to interfere. With time when I grew, I realized that my mom is getting punished for no reason. One day in 2004 my father left us as I was a girl child, hence he never wanted to take our responsibility. My mother took care of me as a single parent. I was too close to her. I never missed my dad.\r\ndid last right of my mom and still remember she always use to say be independent. You are my daughters and I am always there to support you in all highs and lows. I never missed my dad and he never came back. In February 2011, I became cabin crew in charge and I am so proud of my angel mother as she was the one who inspired me. I always walk with my head high. I have learnt that where there is no fear of failure, whatever you do would turn out to be success.PRIYA MAKHIJA",

What inspired me most is her resolve to smile everyday, to bring joy to her family. To be a religious mother, grandmother, and great grandmother. She has taught me to accept things with silent resolve to endeavour and come out for the better. She has taught me to be kindly smart and respect people. She might not have gone out on the world and conquered sea's but she did conquer her fears, struggles, and hardships at home.

She is always being there for me in each and every progression of my life simply like a protector, like an adviser, like a caregiver. All I can say in regard to motherhood that all the love begins and ends there.\r\n\r\nIn a different culture, a Mother has different forename as MOTHER, MAMA, MUMMY, MOM, MAA, etc. I call my beloved Mother as “MAMA”. In fact, I can say that I have no words to fully express the sentiments about my mother.\r\n\r\nLike others, I also have a beautiful experience with my “MAMA”. When I was a kid, she cares for me with so much love and affection. She guides that how to mark a step in each next stage. Her applause when I accomplished something. She undergoes miserable when I lost from my objectives however she never neglected to spur me to continue attempting.\r\n\r\nEven, during my growing age, my “MAMA” showed the significance of life like an educator. She trained me like a soldier to confront the world with courage. She instructed about the tradition and culture of our human society.\r\n\r\nShe shared her experience with me that how to survive in the social life and how to talk mannerly with others.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in my struggling period, “MAMA” dependably addressed that ‘Never loses hope..Everything will be fine..Keep trying and try to be the best version of you’. I never forget that inspiring words of her that energizes me throughout the life. In addition, she taught me every aspect that helps to accomplish my coveted objectives.\r\n\r\nA famous quote by Jewish proverb- “God could not be everywhere, and therefore he made mothers”…. This line clearly characterized that god favored us with an exceptional and valuable blessing as a Mother.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I hope that everyone should concur that the lady as a mother who often loves us and forfeits for us at any condition deserve the best.\r\nI love you, MAMA. You are the real inspiration for me.",

I remain so positive at work, home. I am so blessed that people love me a lot and for them I am an inspiration. I have been to the darkness of hell, endured the most desolate times, and has been made strong through endurance. Now I walk with the FEARLESSNESS of a WOLF, the BRAVERY of the LION, and the FIERCENESS of a DRAGON.\r\n\r\n“ZINDAGI EK BAAR MILTI HAI BILKUL GALAT HAI, SIRF MAUT EK BAAR MILTI HAI, ZINDAGI HAR ROZ MILTI HAI”.\r\nI moved all polished wrapped up in grace, inside is a vulnerable child, and a warrior outside that the world praise.\r\nSo rise above or fall low. It’s your call….!!! I am a survivor. People will quit on you! You got to get up every day and make sure you never quit on yourself. Death is not the greatest loss in life. Loss is when life dies inside you while you are alive. Keep shining as you do. Celebrate this event called LIFE.\r\nLong lost hugs,\r\nPriya Makhija \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

        "description": "My wife and I were waiting to get into an elevator at a metro station in Paris when a tall African American guy stepped into the elevator. He stood to my left and stared at my trolly bag which was quite heavy. He wore a black jacket, was decently groomed and looked pretty smart. \r\n\r\nWhen the elevator stopped, I unsuccessfully tried lifting up my trolly bag. The guy offered help. He grabbed the straps of the bag with one hand and dropped it outside the elevator. After we came out of the elevator, I thanked him for the help. He pointed towards the floor as if I had dropped something and disappeared into thin air. I checked the floor for any possible item that I could have mistakenly dropped. All this while the British woman kept grinning as if she knew something which I didn’t.\r\n\r\nThe train arrived on the platfom and I boarded the train along with my wife. I checked my pant’s side pockets for wallet only to find that it was missing. I rewinded my memory to recall the exact moment when the Afro American guy stealthily maneuvered his hand inside my left pocket on the pretext of helping me lift my bag.\r\nStunned, I recalled that I had my yes bank credit card in the wallet. I immediately callled the credit card customer care helpline which connected me to the yes bank customer care representative. He asked me only two questions- first, is it a staff account and second, what is my date of birth; before blocking my card. After hanging up, I got a message that my credit card transaction of 11 euro was declined at some restaurant in Paris. I heaved a sigh of relief. It hit me that the British woman might be aware of the tricks being played by the thief and that could be the reason why she had that wry smile.\r\n\r\nMy wife, being the super smart wife that she is, had already replaced the euros in the wallet with Rs. 300, credit card and lots of visiting cards. The poor thief was now left with INR 300  after putting in so much of efforts at the risk of getting caught. ",

Due to which i have white spots on my legs and hand too. It is little similar to vitiligo only.  Being a girl, my parents are alwys afraid that how i will live in this world where a girl has to be beautiful only. But now i am a software engineer in a very good company. Evrytym i wear only full length dress and clothes bcoz i dont want to show people my short coming. I want to earn more and more to get proper treatment some where. I have cried alot when people ask what is this on your skin. It is like crying and my life are related to each other. Why i m not normal is one thing alwys comes in my mind. I cannot wear dress of my choice. Every time it is needed to cover the scars other wise what people will say and they will ask always. It would have been very difficult when students bully you and tease to that what is this. But still i focussed on my studies and today i am a software engineer on my own. Life is not easy and was never easy for me. But still i am trying hard to make a good life for me where my parents will be free from tensions of mine. My own experience tells me that dont stop fighting and you will definitely achieve what you want. Just ignore what people say to bring you down. From crying hard any time cause of my marks and scars to the happiness of getting a good job it was a great journey for me. I am proud of myself that now i am a strong confident girl.",

Not just because she was my mother, but also because she was a loving doctor. She put her duties before herself. Back in her days, she qualified the coveted Christian Medical College examination. Why is this special? Because everyone thought that it wasn’t possible for a Punjabi Girl to clear a Christian Medical College exam. But she did and became one of the top doctors in Delhi NCR. A general physician, I still remember the day we got our home made. With one hand she fed me, her baby and with the other she wrote the prescription for her patient while supervising the cementing of the house. In 2007, she passed away. She caught a disease from one of her patients only. Well, her patient got well and healthy but she couldn’t survive. The only thing she said to me back then was that I should make her proud. I’m trying hard. Just like how she was a thoughtful leader, a thoughtful parent, I am trying to be the same. She told me I need to work hard to make a name in this world. And I’m proud to be following her footsteps. With her light on me, in my second year I was the First Woman President of Enactus Ramjas, Ramjas College. I try to imbibe in me her qualities of hardwork, empathy, dedication and multitasking. I wish I can become even an iota of what she was.",

I can talk to her about problems that I am having in my life and in school. I like talking to my mom because she always listens and gives me good advice. For example when I felt like quitting school because I was stressed out and felt like I wasn't getting anything accomplished she told me to just calm down. She also told me to stop worrying about things that are going on at home and stay focused on my work, because there is nothing I can do about things happening at home while I am down here in school. Another thing I can talk to my mother about is something that most men my age usually wouldn't talk to their mothers about which is, women problems. When I talk to her about my women problems, she always predicts what is going to happen. Whatever she says is going to happen, always happen. For instance when one of my girlfriends from back in the day was lying about something, my mother told me that if I was to just wait and ask her about it another time that her story would be different and all mixed up. It just so happens that it was true. I caught her in a lie and there was nothing that she could do about it but just sit there and look dumb. My mother also tells me what to do if a girl is acting a certain way and if she thinks it will work if I get in a relationship with the girl and why.\r\n             Another reason why my mother is my favorite person is because she is very blunt. She says what she means and means what she says. She will always tell you how she truly feels and give her opinion about something if you ask her. ",

I wanted to do some thing creative n wanted to contribute to society as well . I was 20 years old not even completed my graduation when I got married. More responsibilities involved when I got kid at the age of 22 . But I used to dream of doing something big n wanted to touch skies . In 2009 My kid was Juz one year old n i was so confused about my life that what job should I pick so that I can tke care of him as well, n that was the time when I started my first school n daycare . I was given very less money from the family saying I hve to manage n earn more n if I can’t , not even a penny extra vll b given then. So for me it was a challenge n a question of survival . I put all my efforts n worked so hard that even within 3 months not only break even , I touched the profit as well , then I never looked back n learned that v all have power to manifest what we want in life . Today I hve 6 branches of Thomas kids international. In 2015 I faced health issues because of my non healthy eating habits . I became overweight also. I overcome that also n took my physical fitness as a challenge again .Not only that I run marathons now n support many runs n NGOs today . I m a successful business entrepreneur n a runner n a mother of 12 years old kid at the age of 34 . I m a pinkathon ambassador n work with Milind Soman n spread awareness about breast cancer in women’s . On September 2 nd m going for Ladakh marathon, the worlds highest altitude run . I m super proud of myself n believe in my power of manifestation. I manage my business as well as my running involvements n serve my family n my kid as well n never miss on to gym for 2 hours every day . Now m not a fairy but m a dragon with wings n super powers .",

I was so lucky to have him and born as a grandson to him offcourse i was the most loved and pempered one . I was inspired by his nature and kindness how he sacrifised all of his life and wishes for his family . He taught me everything . Be a good person , always be helpful to other without any expectations , always carry a smile on your face , be thankful for what you have , Enjoy every moment of life .He taught me the value of family and parents how important they are to us as we can never pay them for what they have done for us . I feel like i have earned alot of experience in just 20 years of age because of him . We both used to share everything with each other just like Best friends . In 20 years of my life I have learned how important family and friends are for us because you cannot buy them . You will earn money your entire life but not these realtions . You realise the value of money when u loose something that you cannot buy with money . I feel like i have mirrored his personality and i want to stay the same spreading love and kindness like him only . I know he must be proud of what I am today . He was and  he is always with me .Present in my mind and my Heart  forever ❤ ",

She gave birth to her 4th child girl after 3 sons in a cow shelter.\n\nWhen her mother refused to help her she started begging on railway platforms. The orphans children's on those platforms move to Sindhutai and then she decided to look after them.  And today's Sindhutai is affectionately known as a mother of orphans. She adopted and nurtured more than 1400 orphans and by doing her work she have been received 500 award of appreciation.\n\nSindhutai Sapkal called ‘Mai’, is a social worker in Maharasthra, India. She is a social activist who works  pationatly towards the welfare of orphaned children in India. Having built a grand family over the decades, she now has one thousand grandchildren who are offsprings of the children she had previously adopted! Most of her ‘children’ are doing very well in life- some are lawyers, some are doctors and so on. In fact, one of her children is pursuing a PhD on Sindhutai’s life. Some of them are even running their own independent orphanages, and proliferating her good deed and spirit. This holds true even for her biological daughter!\n",

Her smile after a hectic day fills me with an energy that makes me active throughout the day. Her self confidence makes me believe that a woman can look beautiful even with grey hair and without any make-up. I have learnt that age is just a number if you believe in urself. One can wear traditional attire and look trendy. One can respect elders still can look cool. At last I would like to tell myself that 'hey girl keep going and growing everyday, you are my rockstar so keep shining and keep spreading your happiness'. ",

In our life we all get a chance to prove our self and that chance makes us shine. \n\nThe above lines are applied to me as well, when I got that chance, I found myself independent & doing well in my life.\n\nSome one has once well quoted that “ behind every successful man there is a woman behind rolling her eyes”, and I found myself lucky to have one such woman in my life who always supported me, guided me and helped me to sail through in all ups and down of my life and she is none other than my MOM.\n\nShe is the most bold, beautiful and intelligent lady behind me. She guides me in each and every step of my life. She became my friend when I was teenager and a guide when I was struggling in my life to settle my self. She made me comfortable in every stage of my life. She never judges me or misunderstands me.\n\nEach one of us faces that phase of life when we found that all are friends are settled and doing well, and an unseen pressure is developed on us. This is the time where we need a support. At that time also she stood by me and helped me to become what I am today.\n\nShe is the lady of great will power and confidence. Throughout her life she had worked very hard to support our family. She stood like a pillar with my Dad . she is the one who first support me financially when I was  going to start my business and found lack of money. She gave me financial support and moral support too. Time to time  she guides me in my job  as she also belongs to the same field in her job profile, so you can also say professionally  I had chosen the same as business that was her working profile. There was a time when I was not doing good in my business. She gave me a great break through and I got a very good opportunity to develop my business. I grab it and after that there is no looking back in my life. \nShe choose a very beautiful and intelligent life partner for me ( as I said her “mom life partner to ",

Giving credit to one women who inspires us is not accurate as from time to birth till date, many women playes important role in my life. Firstly my Mother who got married when she is 18 and gave birth to two kids. Though she had chance to study she gave up her her career for sake of family and played important role in trying to make us better people. Once my brother and me reached 25, she started searching suitable alliance for us. That was the time she came to know how her son has fallen into trap in the bame of love with a widow and was beaten up by certain people for money which he tried to hide from us. She gave strength to my dad and me to help my brother  get out of the trouble. Once I got married and she came to know I was not given to a proper family she suffered a lot of pain unable to see my position in my in-law's place. When I was pregnant I always had a hatred for girl child as I was afraid of sending my kid to a different house post marriage aftrt treating her like princess. My mother helped me to get rid of my fear while my Grandmother told me to be bold and have enough patience to manage myself at in-law's house. Now once am busy with my career and struggle with my little girl, my mom and her mothet took my daughter with them and is focusing on moulding her future thinking my daughter as their daughter....",

A very young age, her parents used to pamper her at silly silly situation, she was very sensitive, where as his husband, he was the one who ruined her whole life, he just destroyed her life , he was very harsh, rude, he used to humiliate her, hit her, beat, her even when she was pregnant.. His first wife left him cz of same issues which got to know later. And she was the second one, he was so scared of him still she loved him, but once done is done, when everyone was sleeping, she ran out to her own parents house,. Her husband called her n said if ur not comming ill give u divorce n the next moment said i love u plz come back because he'd realized that he is not hvng a proof that she was pregnant, so the world will think ki he is a sterile so the reason both of her wife ran away, one after the marriage, n called me back home saying ily n all.. N i went back... After about one day he did all the tests, after he got a prove that he is not a sterile he decided to kill her n her child.,,,,, he told her to leave the house or kill the child n do whatever u want to do, she went upstairs n called her parents from in laws phone, n the phone got recorded, n in laws heard the calling n shouted n pushed,,,, after all this she started bleeding but she kept it a secret cz then she knows her husband's nature.. Next day her parents came and took her back saying she'll come back in a week, but she was scared so she didn get back to that house.. The most she was scared was about those pictures, he used to take his nude pictures n used tp say if u leave me, ill viral those pictures.. And then in depression whn he was still humiliating her thru phone n relatives n many ways.. She got depressed n she lost her child due to heavy bleeding :( AND after that she got strong and decided to stand up for justice n went to police but no one helped her there so she filed a case against her husband n so on!!

She understood her responsibility of being a wife, a mother and a dog mom, she decided to share the workload & start working on a commercial upfront.

She at the village level never gave up her fight in her daily life, protection of Bogmalo village, villagers and it's Beach.\n2. Daily life: She being educated unemployed the going was always tough for the family. Latter when my Dada was suspended pending enquiry by person without designation /enquiry never conducted; as Accounts Manager from five star Beach resort for refusing to make illegal payments / wrongly accounting to politicians for Sea side illegal constructions, hill/tree cutting, sewage going to Sea etc. So as  a housewife with single earning member the going was smooth but for the last ten years it was hell in this inflatory world.\n\n3. The challenge at the village was always tough as panchas/sarpanch, politicians and administrators were greedy for more money and we're always interested about their illegal well being. Mass felling of trees and cutting hills for illegal constructions in no development zone blocking access to the beach or paddy fields converted and high rise building permitted by turning a blind eye due to corruption. She approached various authorities including GCZMA and Hon'ble National Green Tribunal which gave it's direction to GCZMA to initiate action within three months some two years back, but GCZMA failed however to file contempt before Hon'ble National Green Tribunal was long for but avoided for want of money.\n\n4. Bogmalo Beach was awarded a best Beach and Rs11/- posted stamp awarded on golden jubilee now destroyed inspite being declared a No development zone, it's access blocked by illegal constructions of shacks, bar & restaurants and guesthouses.\n\n5. Bog means Bay and Malo means greenery, both on the verge of distinction, hills cut/ trees felled where will birds like peacock nest? or even leapords on hill side are trapped in cages, moon light shooting in sea; such is the greed of human destruction or even guesthouses ",

I refuse to find fault with this woman, because to me, she is the ultimate example of what a woman is. She never lectures, never moralizes, but instead she is a perfect example by the way she lives and the way she conducts herself throughout her life. She lives a life filled with integrity, with dignity, and with quiet wisdom. If she could only know that I hold her in the highest of esteem. And how much she means to me she would understand integrity, love and honor has changed my life. \n             The first time that I saw this question for this essay, one woman came to mind. As the answer Her name is Nanda and she truly is phenomenal. She was there for me when it felt like the rest of the world walked out and she continues to stand by my side through thick and thin. For that I am forever grateful. This definitely isn't the only thing that makes her phenomenal. I didn't meet her until way after all of my family problems happened. When she and I met I was 17 and I didn't think anything of her until I really started to talk to her. I am now 41 and she is 38 and she is and always will be my Guardian Angel. I honestly don't think that I would be the way I am today if it wasn't for her and here is why.\n             I give credit to this woman in my life, which has taught me many lessons, but mostly through positive uplifting experiences. From these experiences Nanda has always been present, teaching me, giving me strength, courage and wisdom; encouraging me to be more, to strive harder, to have confidence and most importantly to seek divine knowledge and understanding. The woman who raised me never taught these teachings to me, so Nanda is the phenomenal woman in my life.",

Her tireless courage in the face of adversities teaches me that the night always passes and the sun comes up. Her grit and determination move me to never stop succeeding. She teaches me that failure is not when we fall, but when we don’t get up to overcome millions of other falls that will come our way. My mother may not have given me birth, but she gives me life by loving me with all her affection. No she’s not always appreciative of me and it’s hard to understand why, but finally I have understood that it is important to correct your loved ones when they are wrong, because love entails company not just when everything is going right, but also when the times are tough and you’re almost losing the fight. She’s beautiful inside out, and her kindness inspires me to strive to be a even as part as good as her. My heart goes out to all the mothers and fathers .",

The brave 23 year old didn’t flinch in the face of adversity and saved over 350 lives with her selflessness, bravery and calm demeanour. Her perseverance, both in her personal and professional life inspire me to face the hardships of life with a smile on my face. She could have escaped the plane and saved her life but she kept her duty towards other passengers over self which is a trait rarely possessed by people of our generation.",

It so happened that few years ago a girl fell from DTC bus due to her own fault. My wife Bharti was in the bus. She immediately took the girl to AIIMS trauma center in Delhi when no one was thinking to help as it would result in police case. The timely action saved the girl and police in trauma center were helpful. Few days later her brother called up and said that my wife deposes in front of court n say it's driver fault so that he can earn but my wife did not agree. This is one of the odd cases. It appears simple but at that moment taking decisions is not so simple. Taking out valuable time from your life and job is not simple. Taking decisions in spur of moment is not simple . These are the factors that she is my source of inspiration and energy",

        "description": "Above name mentioned is of my mom. She has inspired me in every single step of my life. I have grown so much inside and outside just by following on her examples. She lost her father when she was 2 years old. She didn't know what father love is. But i was fortunate enough for 18 years of my life. I lost my father when I just completed my 12th. Those recent few years were hard for me and my family as we all were very dependent on him. \nBut my mother she took care of three families at that moment and her job simultaneously. Our own family, my nani ji family( since she is the only child) and my dadi ji's old home.. She handled it all. \nI don't have any idea how, but she did all she could do best and she did great.\nIn those tough times too, she never uttered a word that she is going through a lot. We three (my sister, my brother and me) we all have moved out to cities to pursue higher education or to work further as back there are not enough options to earn. She has been manging all of it alone there.\nWhenever I have called her I only hear a firm and confident voice on phone no matter in how much pain she is in just so as that we do not take tension and concentrate more in our studies or our job. At harsh times like when I was searching for job and it was taking time, she motivated me enough to keep me going in the right direction and never settle for what is not worth the value. Whenever I think about it deeply, she never had too much happiness and yet she tries to stay calm and happy. Did not see father love, when it was time to enjoy life with husband she lost him as well nd now when she took retirement all her kids are out for jobs. AND YET SHE IS HAPPY AND CALM. \nSo, if I have a mother so inspiring how can I stay down and not hussle with life. She is all what keeps me going in all situations. She has a kind heart, people still take advantage of that. She has always been nicer to everyone and even harsh to some who needs a dose. I only wish for her happines. d/o MOM",

Her other siblings also needed to be educated.\nOne evening she heard her mother gave her gold ornaments even  mangalsutra to her father so that they could get a loan for her MBBS entrance exam at the Medical College. All these sacrifices had motivated her to do her best and live a life which would make her parents proud.As all her education was done in the Hindi medium, she was not able to cope up with her studies in the first year in medical college. The medium of learning was English and suddenly her mother lost eyesight and so she failed.

My aunt was a nurse she truly inspired me care and compassion to the patients were really touching.\n\nWhen I was in school, I often visited the Government hospital were my aunt was working.\n\nAfter my high school , I expressed my ambition to my aunt; her advice was “don’t consider nursing as a profession but consider as an occasion”. Whenever I’m in uniform I still consider this as an occasion for serving the suffering, and the satisfaction it gives to me is beyond all the monetary benefits. \n\nAfter I become an Nurse, I was a CCU nurse taking care of patients, which I truly love doing. It was challenging at times but very rewarding.  I love to help patients and their families. I love learning new techniques and procedures. I found that in nursing there is a door to learn something every day. Also my wife is working as nurse.",

The things which inspire me have been written in a way of poetry below.\r\n\r\nShe is 46 years old,\r\nHowever, not so bold.\r\nHaving one makhan-chor\r\nWhom she does not scold.\r\n\r\nShe does all home chores,\r\nCooking, stitching and many more. \r\nIn her mind she has stored,\r\nShe has never been adored. \r\n\r\nIt makes me weep when she is sad,\r\nMy goddess never thinks bad.\r\n\r\nShe wants a beautiful home,\r\nWith no affect of rain and storm. \r\nSees the things she wants to buy,\r\nNo big home makes idea fly.\r\n\r\nI always think what should I do,\r\nThings for which mom feels blue.\r\n\r\nWith hardwork, I will make it true.\r\nI will try and never skew.\r\n\r\nIt takes blood, sweat and tears,\r\nBut today, I have no fear.\r\n\r\nIt is do or die situation,\r\nThere must be no procrastination. \r\n\r\nAs the time is running fast,\r\nMakes my mind sometimes blast.\r\n\r\nIn this poem whatever I say,\r\nI always think when I hit the hay.",

In the late seventies (1977)I had a shampoo manufacturing unit in Ankleshwar GIDC. She used to assist me in all matters of business. In 1982 I met with a road accident and was completely on bed for 8 months. During the period she learned how to make shampoos from the home and started selling it from home.In the year 1985, I have to liquidate my factory due to financial crisis. As designing of furnitures is my hobby I started it professionally. During the transit period of business, she continued to make shampoos in bulk and selling it in parlours , saloons and also to individuals as our shampoos quality was very good. Thus she continued to make shampoos for about ten years together to support the family. We have two daughters both studying in Aux. Convent School. Hansa regularly seat with them for their study.

But after observing her and following her the same attitude of not to give up easily on even smallest or largest of the activities, now even I am able to think that I would easily do any work assigned to me as my attitude towards  the approach of any process is changed. It might sound a bit magical or unrealistic  but seriously it works. Never give up attitude helps to you keep on finding the way untill you reach your destination. Also this attitude helps to keep our journey to reach the destination exciting as well as full if motivation. My true inspiration, my wife. ",

With no family members to take care of them, she looked for her mother for support. However the condition presented another challenge. Her mother was short of eyesight and her father not mentally sound .To add to the woes her elder sister had also lost her husband and returned back with two young kids, and another  sister also separated with two kids. The family went through untold suffering , living on borrowed food, in a small space. Inspite of all the hardship, her never say die attitude prevailed. She took the initiative to start a food delivery service to few people.  She had to do cooking to delivery service, all by herself with young girl child in her hips all through. The only thing which kept her going , as she recalls was the words of support her blind mother provided, She supported both her elder sisters and even managed to send their children to school. Over the years, she started providing employment to others, bought the place which she had rented to run her business and married off her child. When everthing seemed settled, lightning struck second time, this time in the form of Tuberculosis, which made her bedridden and it was doubtful if she would recover ever. She underwent back bone replacement, came back strongly due to her pure will power and now continues to run her business successfully. \nShe is the live example who is a real source of inspiration for her positive approach towards life. She always reminds me that it is the attitude which define us, and determines how we face our problem . Human life is not one to be bogged down, rather the hope for better tomorrow is that keeps us working all the time. What more inspiration can one ask for from the people whom we see in our daily life. She inspires us to fly just like the butterfly, w",

        "description": "The first woman IPS officer of India, an inspiring role model, a Ramon Magsaysay awardee Kiran Bedi has a powerful influence on my life. Two beliefs of her which always give me courage. Life is always on incline way- It either goes up or down. 100 things happen in life- 99% things are your own creations. If good happens enjoy and if bad happens learn from them. 1 % things are beyond your control and you can’t do anything about it like natural calamities, death of your near ones etc. Only you can respond to such situations with all the courage stored in you with no place for fear. The iron lady, who joined Indian Police as a tough woman, a woman with infantile stamina. For her, police stood for power to correct instead of power to punish and believed in equal policing despite of all men around her. It was first and the last time when the Prime Minister of India was given a parking ticket. She denied self-glorification by refusing Asian Jyoti award as it was not for her whole traffic unit. The rule was simple-pro justice because of which she was sent to indiscreet postings where others would say ‘No’. She was sent to prison assignment, was a den of criminals-10000 men to 400 women to lock her thinking as there will be no car and no parking tickets to vips or ministers. She never complained about anything what was left over by the officers earlier in Tihar jail or in other postings of her. She started education and meditation in prison and converted prison to ashram and was instrumental in introducing prison reforms. A beginning of a bigger change.  Change is never easy and full of challenges and when those moments pass, we discover the hidden strength that exists in each of us. She is currently into movements of education and anti -corruption. I take this platform to thank you for being there without knowing how you are still changing my life and Celebrate HER in every woman who gets inspired by such persona even if it means that you are the only woman doing it.",

        "description": "This is a rare story about a husband being truly inspired from his wife. But I truly am inspired by her!\nMy wife Richa is a clinical psychologist qualified from Delhi university. Clinical psychology was then, not a popular degree & hence she had decided to be a homemaker years back.\nNot sure, but probably I started undermining her role as a homemaker & hence pushed her to work in a nearby school. While she worked at school for 2 years, her heart was never there in the school job as she could not put her clinical psychology degree & counselling skill set to proper use. Her dislike for school job was further aggravated with long working hours, young child & household work.\nRicha suggested me that she should start her own psychology practice but dint get enough support from my end. Fortunately, Richa did not listen to me & decided to go ahead with her dreams and started her own practice. She managed everything with her own finances & contacts. As I could not contribute much to her cause, in fact I initially discouraged her, Richa took every step on her own. She set her clinic, struggled, single handedly and courageously kept moving ahead. Determined she was !\nToday, after years of successful practise she has carved a niche for herself as a psychologist & marriage counsellor. She is counselling her clients who are struggling in different streams of her life. She helps people who have lost all hopes. Her counselling has saved many marriages and have helped many people recover from utmost depression. People who have taken her counselling sessions rave about her & say that her counselling sessions have been life changing experiences for them. \nShe is TRULLY making a difference & contributing to the society. I am so proud & inspired by her.\nShe was also felicitated with prestigious Devi awards’16 @ Hyderabad by Shri Venkaiah Naidu, current Vice President. Devi awards recognises & awards exceptional women across the country who display dynamism & innovation in their work.\n",

My family introduced me to a guy and made me believe that he and his family are not at all interested in any kind of monetary benefits from us. I believed them and got married.

        "description": "It was half past four - a cold January morning - even the sun had decided to sleep in - but it was another glorious busy morning for this middle-aged, white-haired woman. She woke up briskly, did her morning activities, tied a soft cotton saree and bustled outside to clean and water the front-area of the home, put kolam and hurry back inside with the milk-packet. She warmed the milk and with the aroma of hot filter coffee in the air, she went back to the bedroom and with her gentle hands on my forehead and a soft voice ... she said ‘coffee is ready. Get up. You said you have to study’. This is how I  remember being woken up until my 12th grade...then in 12th grade she fell really sick - cancer took over and my Mom left - never to come back again. Life changed for me ... I got busy being young. \r\nNow at 40, when I look back... what she said and did not say... the way she was... has inspired me in ways unimaginable. She was married young to my dad and had not completed her 8th grade. But she fit into the family and took care of all of my dad’s brothers and sisters. She bore 5 daughters and ensured all 5 got educated and became independent. She always said- ‘you girls study and make your father proud. I will take care of the cooking and cleaning’. The house was always a home - clean, vibrant, warm food ...\r\nEvery evening at around 9:00 pm she would wait outside for my dad because that was when he would get back home from office. She would serve him food and then only rest for the day. Never have I seen her fight with him or raise her voice. They must have had their moments ... but none of us children had to ever witness that. My dad was not a business man ... nor was he very rich. But there was always enough at home and my mom never complained. \r\nAll her life - she gave to others what she never could have. Years later - - The warmth of her embrace still lingers....and she is MY inspiration - today and everyday.",

        "description": " My inspiration is Mother Teresa. The beauty of Mother Teresa is her power of love, unconditional love. She was a messenger who always had something to teach others, not through sermons but through compassion and mercy.\n\n   One of the things that immediately inspired me about Mother Teresa was her ability to put her trust in God’s call for her. Mother Teresa never questioned what God wanted her to do. In an article about her called I Thirst, Mother Teresa explained her call to serve the poor by saying, “the message was quite clear. I was to leave the convent and consecrate myself completely to help the poor and live among them. It was an order. I knew where I belonged, but I did not know how to get there.” As soon as God spoke to her, she was willing to follow his call. I don’t think I could so blindly follow God’s call, especially if it called me to leave the comfort of my home or in her situation the Loretta Sister’s Convent. Not only was Mother Teresa willing to leave her home, but she left without having anywhere to go, another thing that I don’t have enough bravery to do. I was inspired by Mother Teresa willingness to follow God’s call, even though she didn’t have a clear path laid out for her.\n\n  Mother Teresa’s service to the poor and dying in Calcutta drew many of the students taught by the Loretta Sister to join her in service. Mother Teresa didn’t advertise or work to convince people to follow what she did, but through her actions, she inspired people to follow God’s call.\n\n",

In the summer of 2017 I was running a mega project on financial literacy and enrolled 27000 students. After successful completion of competitive exam it was the time to correct papers and declare results. My staff committed many mistakes in running the system. Due date of results was around the corner. She came in and spend 3 nights to clear the mess and get the things done. This is after taking care of full family responsibilities, kid's studies. With complete devotion she helped me successfully complete the project. One thing that inspired me was what ever work she takes, she ensures to complete with full dedication and accuracy. With out credits she works selflessly. ",

        "description": "Mother Teresa-born on Aug 26, 1910. Yes, today is her birthday & I take pleasure in writing about this motherly figure on her birthday. Her birthday is debateable as for some its 26th & for some it's on 27th. Nevertheles, she shares her birthday with my grandmother, if on 26th Aug & my mother if on 27th Aug. So she is close to my heart and a mother due to her kindness to the needy; shown in the way she devoted her life to caring for the poor indian kids suffering from leprocy and tuberculosis as if they were her own. At age 12 she had a calling from God & joined the church. At the age of 18 she left home for a few months' training in Dublin and came to India to teach at St.Mary’s High School Calcutta, but the suffering she saw made an impact on her and she had a 2nd calling from God to help the needy & she left her job to devote herself to the poor to start an open air school. I got inspired from her & got Masters in Teaching from USA. I volunteered in a shelter in NYC and cared for the children there like my own. I also taught in kindergarten and in \r\nhigh schools after which i came back to India and joined a rotract club to help the poor, organised eye camps & visited old age homes & orphanages. I volunteered in foundations to teach kids soul songs, fed them, organised health camps and took kids to hospitals for treatment in Hernia, Anemia, Aids etc. I later joined a Cancer foundation for Children where we funded hospitals towards cancer. We distributed spiritual books for kids so their faith in a super power increased and learnt about the souls journey to a higher kingdom which rekindled a hope for a better life. Mother Teresa's Divine confidence and calling and my divine confidence and calling are similar. Recently I taught Yoga in ashrams for children and teachers which gave me a sense of satisfaction so that they can stay healthy. When they learn how to connect to a super power within themselves by yoga & pranayam there wiill be lesser chances of diseases.",

The feeling of appreciation and the satisfaction it gives them knows no bounds. This is just the start. I thank Mother Teresa for teaching me how to lead a life. She have left her body on World Teachers day, 5th September 1997 and have taught me an enormous teaching lesson for a lifetime. I cherish her incomparable work towards humanity.

If I call her the way of living, it won’t be wrong. The word mother and all we can associate it with is love , care , warmth and selfless love . Coming from a joint family , different people along with different mindset and opinions with a lot more responsibilities . In every situation I found her smiling and telling me responsibilities won’t change all that is in your hand is your attitude towards them, so why not perform them happily it will make your job more easier. She was loved by all, that selfless love inspires me.\r\n28th November, 2013 was the day when her reports came and she was detected with ovarian cancer. In shock and grief and more of a fear since I had lost my grandfather too fighting the same disease few years earlier but her smile and her same confidence that whatever it is I am going to love and live each day with a smile kept us hopeful. 21 chemotherapy, surgery and each passing day more challenges but she was strong telling the oncologist she can take the 22nd chemo too, the pain she had gone through and the courage she had were both high.\r\nWhenever she visited the oncologist there were patients sitting outside with a tired look and sometimes teary eyes , going through the same she used to motivate them talk to them speaking only positive things with a message that cancer is not an end .\r\nAfter two years of treatment there was a day when the reports were normal, the day we laughed , celebrated specially my father who must have not even had a sound sleep in those two years was relieved. We started living once again had it not been for mom’s courage and determination. After 6 months it relapsed and we lost her but her strength is alive in our hearts that is the reason she is my inspiration. ",

Her first space began in 1997. The very first Indian woman and second Indian person to fly in space after Rakesh Sharma. In 2000, again she got selected for her second flight which delayed due to some conflicts and technical reasons. In 2003, she took her second fly with her other six crew members but unfortunately she got killed in Space Shuttle Columbia disaster with the other six members. We lost a great woman who was full of spirit, she died like a hero, who is still alive in all of our hearts.\r\n\r\nA role model for many young woman in India & around the world. Belonging from a small town, a bag full of big dreams within it. She took step and fought hard against various rules set by society to change her dreams into reality.\r\nShe is the best example for all those young women who want to pursue their dreams but due to some circumstances either it can be, society, parents, lack of confidence, a fear to be unsuccessful etc, stops to follow your dreams. But in my opinion we should never hesitate to speak all about instead of keeping the things in yourself.\r\n\r\nHer persistent motivation booster was her parents. Her parents never forced her to come back and settle down in India. They kept on motivating and praising her throughout the journey of her life. The fact is, as when your parents start supporting your dreams, then half of the path seems like you have already crossed.\r\n\r\nWe all should learn & push yourself for getting successful in achieving goals like her.\r\n\r\nA very inspiring message from her to all the parents “ Never underestimate a daughter, who knows, if your daughter can also become another Kalpana Chawla”. A great inspiration to all the ladies, and a salute to all the parents who support their daughter, to follow her dreams, keep her motivating, help he",

Family so orthodox that even returning home at 6.30 in eve was a sin.\nI fought for my rights and dreams of other similar girls who really want to do something of their own. \nI have always been a shield to the girls in Katni (Place where I belong to).  Taken a step and fought to go out for bachelors. Fought to further go to Pune for Masters. Not only this, I fought to work and make my own stand.\nToday, I am at position, that people give my reference in Katni and send their daughters out to become educated and successful.\n.\n.\nSeen lot of mothers crying out of happiness and thanking me as their daughters now stand head holding high!\n I have always believed in saying -Try, Try, Try, till you succeed and followed the same blindly.\nI am happy I took that step and would be grateful to god for leading me towards that direction.\n\nHope my story really inspires every small town girl to achieve big dreams.\n- Julie\n(Mumbai today, Tomorrow the world)  ",

Always in pursuit of implementing her business ideas, Jayanti started selling home made 'modaks' via the then popular social networking platform 'Orkut'. Word had started to get out, but destiny had different plans for her. She had to move to Australia as her husband got transferred onshore. However, this didn't deter her from making homemade Indian cuisines for their new friends there. After returning to India, she had a baby and joined Infosys as a Technology Lead. Within a span of 2 years, she got promoted to the position of a Project Manager. Jayanti had over the years built a strong profile in key technology areas such as Microsoft XAML, C#, Windows 8 App Development, .NET, Silverlight, SQL Server and Oracle.\n\nDuring this time, she had started developing her catering business as well. Demand for freshly prepared, delicious, home-cooked food always seemed to pick up during festival times like Holi and Diwali. Years of serving food had made Jayanti realise that people who stay away from their families, always craved for access to traditional food.\n\nThey received from their company to add to their funds to start PurnaBramha - an authentic Maharashtrian restaurant in Bangalore. They fetched a cook from their native place and set up the restaurant in HSR layout.\nThey had started off with the idea to not just introduce the highly nutritious Maharashtra cuisine to their non-Maharashtrian brethren, but to also deliver a truly cultural ambience with endearing customer service. They believe their USP lies in their subtle variety and strong flavours and hope to treat thousands with the legendary hospitality that the Maharashtrian community takes pride in.\n\nWith a staff of 40+, Jayanti and her team aim to open 5000 centers across the globe.\nShe takes pride in women leadership and has maintained a 50% staff of women at her restaurant.",

Her decision to look after orphaned children was triggered by her own life experiences. During her childhood Sindhutai went through phases where she missed having someone by her side.\nSindhutai’s entire life inspires me because she has shown how adversity brings out the best in us and dedicated her life to adopting & nurturing orphans. Further, she constructed more than six orphanages in Maharashtra where orphaned children are given food, shelter, and education. Her organization also gave shelter to numerous women, who are destitute and abandoned.\nIn 42 years she has raised about 1,200 children. Her inspiring journey shows that for a committed individual nothing is impossible. Sindhutai is an epitome of Humanity. From being a deprived wife to begging on the streets, she has now become a ‘Mother of orphans and helpless’ children. Even at 70 she has the same drive to do something good for society.\nMany of her adopted children are now highly qualified for e.g. doctors and lawyers. Some adopted children have started orphanages of their own.",

After my schooling, i stepped into Engineering, Everyone in family and relatives suggested so i went for it. Slowly i realised this is what i belongs to. i suppose be to somewhere else.  i always had a hobby of taking pictures on my phone and whatever camera i get.  So gradually i thought i should focus on photography, and i bought i camera. And then one day, I got to know about a online fillmaking completion which was held by YES BANK only.  I was supposed to make a short film within 48hours. I took that challenge and started filming by my own. after shooting when i sat for the editing, i got to know that I've not got the enought clips to make a story i already thought. and it was already late to shoot more there were just few hours left for submission. Then i thought lets not do this. maybe next time, i lost all the hopes. and Then This girl. Prachii gave me motivation to not to loose hope and do it anyhow, no matter what footage you've got just make something out of it. I still didn't want to do it, but her words made me work on the video again. i started again and i somehow manage to submit the video at the last moment. Though it was not a good film,  i didn't get any reward or anything, but making that film first time  was itself an achievement for me. And from that day i decided, i should seek my career into videos only.  & now I'm working as a cinematographer done some good international projects too.  No matter what, she will be always my inspiration. I'm here today is just because of her.  ",

Her dream of pursuing higher studies in a dream college was compromised as she was considered not so smart enough. Overcoming all odds, she could excel in her Bachelors, bag a job as a software engineer in an MNC, where she learnt about growth opportunities ahead. Working as a software engineer till 5pm and preparing for CAT post office hours was very tiresome. But her work ethics never let her compromise on her performance. She found favour in the eyes of management, received many awards for her excellence and brilliance at her workplace. Also, she could make it to an IIM, one of the most prestigious institutes to study in. Many of her friends who were jealous of her success tried to demoralize her as she was from a backward caste but she shielded herself by positivity and self-motivation. But holding on to the same passion, she graduated from IIM as one among the top 10% in terms of academic record and also placed in a very reputed firm. At her workplace she continues to battle against all odds and tries to deliver her best for the growth of the organization. The Her in the story is Shanti, myself and I am highly motivated and proud of Her.",

She is my power house, a Dronacharya to this Eklavya in every sense of the word. Smiling while being thrashed in the clutches of poverty, raising all her five children to be respectable citizens, writing poetries and articles while cooking in an old stove was no less than Rani Laxmibhai reigning over her beloved people. She ensured everyone was fed even when her hand was almost scalded bearing third degree burns from a domestic accident, she ensured her graduation aided the completion fo education not only of her own children but also her grandchildren. She in her humble nine yards clad petite frame painted a silhouette that resonated a battalion that guarded a nation. \nAt times when the corporate world fathomed to engulf this chartered accountant, Parukutti’s image was enough to kindle me to essay an alternate strategy to win over all challenges. A dull moment in personal life, her smiling face permanently etched in my mind reassures there exists sunshine at the end of the tunnel. I yearn to be a mother like her, a spouse like her and a woman like her that oozed love without expecting anything at all in return! Her hands always fed and protected, her feet never knew the flavour of rest, her lips that were tireless to smile and her heart of pure gold, if only the metal was worth comparing to her!\nWhile we look at world leaders and great scholars for inspiration, there stands my unsung heroin, my paternal grandmother, Parukutti! A small town girl from Taleserry (Kerala), an ardent writer that inspires all of us in the family to achieve great heights in our lives. Her writing inspired this humble Chartered Accountant to become a commercially published author and win multiple accolades for her tales in a number of national and international forums. ",

However, we barely spare a glance for the mother, sister, daughter, wife who in her own unique way is the hub of her family.\nOne such unsung heroine was my mother-in-law, Edith Correa.\nShe never held a paying job or was known beyond family circles but left a mark on all the people she interacted with. She called a spade a spade and never minced words when she spoke. It was her forceful personality which enabled her to raise 8 success stories, her 6 sons and 2 daughters. Five of her sons went on to become engineers and rose to the heights of their professions. Her sixth son became a master Mariner and her daughters, a lawyer and a doctor.\nShe was the wife of a railwayman with a meagre salary but knew the importance of education for her children. Her great faith in God took her to church daily and she would often be found singing 'I just keep trusting my Lord' in her kitchen.\nWhy is she such a source of inspiration? She was a strong woman, a good wife and mother, the bedrock of her family. It is on the foundation of such women of substance that, strong families are built and on these are built a nation. Like my mother-in-law who did ordinary things in extraordinary ways, there are many inspirational Indian women who may not make it to the covers of magazines and newspapers but are celebrities and heroines in their homes.",

        "description": "Nivedita’s Mission – ”Deification of Motherland”\n\nDr. Bhupendra Nath Dutta the illustrious younger brother of swami Vivekananda and revolutionary has rightly pointed out in his inspiring work, Swami Vivekananda-Patriot-Prophet, the primary object of swami Vivekananda was nationalism. To arouse the sleeping lion of India and put it on its proper pedestal was his life’s mission. His national ideal was the ideal of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyaya as depcited in the revolutionary novel, Ananda Math. The Swamiji proclaimed to his countrymen that motherland and the children of the mother are the only gods to be worshiped.  Nivedita said that Swamiji advised her to dedicate her life for the service of the Mother. She says, Swamiji asked me to forge a mighty weapon out of the bones of the Bengali youths which can free India.\n\nFreedom of India has been attained, but we are yet to free ourselves from the bondage of intellectual slavery. The western materialistic outlook and a carving to raise the standard of living at the cost of standard of life is eating into the core of vitals of our national life. It is carrying a need of the hour to arouse once again the patriotic sentiments and spirit of deep respect and reverence to the eternal values of life propounded by our great masters, in the hearts of our people, especially the younger generation. She has given the clarion call: Age succeeds age in India, and even the voice of the Mother calls upon her children to worship her with now offerings, with renewal of their own greatness. Today she asks, as a household mother of the strong men whom she has borne and bred that we show to her not gentleness and submission, but manly strength and invincible might. Today she would hat we play before her with the sword. Today se would find herself the mother of a hero clan. Today she cry once more that she is hungered and only by the lives and blood of the Kings and men, can the citadel be saved.\n\n",

        "description": "As part of the Quit India Movement, members of the Congress planned to take over the various police stations of Medinipore district and other government offices. This was to be a step in overthrowing the British government in the district and establishing an independent Indian state. Hazra, who was 71 years at the time, led a procession of six thousand supporters, mostly women volunteers, with the purpose of taking over the Tamluk police station.When the procession reached the outskirts of the town, they were ordered to disband under Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code by the Crown police. As she stepped forward, Hazra was shot once. Apparently, she had stepped forward and appealed to the police not to open fire at the crowd.The Biplabi newspaper of the parallel Tamluk National Government commented: Matangini led one procession from the north of the criminal court building; even after the firing commenced, she continued to advance with the tri-colour flag, leaving all the volunteers behind. The police shot her three times. She continued marching despite wounds to the forehead and both hands. As she was repeatedly shot, she kept chanting Vande Mataram.",

People may laugh hearing this but I can feel the warmth of my mother’s womb mentally. My mom stays almost 700 km away from me still doesn’t take more than 18 hrs to reach me whenever I was in need...when I was mentally depressed she was always there by me and taught me not to give up.I could get through my biggest challenge only because of her. I had to stay in hospital for almost 4 months for my pregnancy that too after 4 abortions.when I was completely under bed rest she took care of me again like a mom takes care of a new born baby.I got my little angel because of her support and the confidence she gave. She is woman who walked almost 15 km on 30 th oct 1984 just to take care of my 1 year old elder sister. She taught us a lesson that a woman doesn’t become mother when she delivers a baby she becomes a mother when she is with her children supporting them in crossing every grief and happiness . Though everybody in our family hated us for being born as girls she never bothered others she gave us all respect and treated us like princesses . It is very difficult to write about my mom in a line or two because words cannot express what I have in my mind and how much she inspires me as a daughter, wife, woman , mother and now grandmother ....,",

Its not easy to carry a child in womb  for 9 months and then sacrifise your entire life just to make your kids future . She is the only one who calls up in the morning and evening to know whether his son had food , if he's doing good  or not . She is the only one who wants me to grow in life as a good person and wants to see me achieveing success and be happy . She doesnt want any part from my salary . What she wants is some Love and care . She finds her happiness in my happiness. I believe spending time and caring for her gives me internal happiness and her blessing could give me what perhaps god could not give me. She is my god i want her to be happy always. ❤",

A country which still witnesses many cases of infanticide, this event proved that a change is brewing. \r\n\r\nGeeta Phogat is now an inspiration for all the girls who want to break away from the social barriers and leave a mark.

        "description": "The ever lasting positivity and zeel to get through everything that life throughs her at is something that I grew up watching. She indeed walks the talk. Yes! Mothers have answers to all (almost all) the questions kids have, specially if you are a teacher by heart and profession. I say almost is because, me and my brother were curious kids, kids questioning the way of things, scientific facts, when she didn't know the answer, she will get it for us. Well, getting answers in this era seems easy and just a click away, not if it was 90s. Again, we can say how can that be so different for a special mention here. Okay, club it with 2 jobs, studying for 9 yrs after getting married, demanding household (we all know this means a strict mother-in-law), 2 kids to raise wanting to give them everything they never got and none the less financially broke. All this with a big smile on the face. Sometimes I think and even tell my husband that if I am able to do even 10% of what my mom did, I'd be doing he'll lot! As I write this, she is fighting a court case since over a decade now for her right to get paid as per government rules which also resulted to lose her job, but standing up for what is right is of prime importance to her. As we know getting justice in our judicial scheme of things takes patience, persistence and most importantly time - all this again with a smile on face and positivity in talks. People say I couldn't have a better mother, I say I couldn't have a better mother, teacher, friend, and idol. Thank you for letting me share",

I become a dark, frustrated, and vile person to where being near me brings my wife to tears or resentment; but amazingly, throughout the ridiculous mess–she chooses to love me.

At a young age, her father suffered a stroke and was duped by his business partner resulting in dire financial straits. Despite all odds, she took up a job as a teacher while furthering her own education and after graduating, secured a clerical post in a government bank, running her home in a meager salary of Rs 300. Soon, she married the love of her life who has stood by her like a rock all these years - supporting her through every decision she took. After her husband quit his job owing to intense work-pressure and found it difficult to secure a new one, she took up the mantle and was the sole bread-winner for her family of four - giving up every possible comfort and luxury but never once complaining. \nSeema Ladage, my mother, has been one of the most inspirational women I know. Always smiling through it all, always ready to lend a hand to everyone, she is one of the simplest and sweetest person I know. Her story is truly inspirational and makes me proud to know that I'm her daughter. Everyone who knows her loves her for her honesty, her naivety, her openness. She has inspired hundreds through her kind deeds and acts and continues to do so even today. A salute to this simple, yet brave woman who has won at every challenge life threw at her - and continues to stand tall and proud!",

        "description": "In 2010, At that time I was newly married guy. My Lovely Wife just 20 years old, Her name is Ashika.\n\nNow i will come in to the Instance. Due to some unavoidable circumtances, after 3 months from marriage date i resigned my job due to some internal constraints. My relations even parents were murmurred because of the luck of new girl i lost the job. But I know the reason behind the loss of my job, so i didnt heared those gossips.\n\nAfter resigning from my job i tried to applied few companies with the help of nearest Browsing centers. \nDuring that jobless situation i felt shame by asking single rupee from my parents to buy own Internet connection /  Dongle to use the internet from home itself. I shared this to my newly married wife (because they blamed het without their help i have to done this).\n\nCertainly she went inside the room and opened one small box. There she counted few 100 denomination currencies and few coins, collectively it comes around 1500. She kept that money in my hand and asked me to buy the dongle immediately and also asked to start searching jobs. With the help of god , no no With the help of my wife(Surely i will tell like this) Within 2 days i got a fantastic Job in Prime Company. Now i am owning own house, bike , car and a wonderful Kid etc. She is the lucky wife for me.\n\nIn this joy i should not forgot to ask the details of that money she gave right?. yes i asked. She said that money was her savings when she studied her Diploma Course final year , that is her pocket given by her father when she studying (she married me after writing her final year Dip examinations). She kept safely and gave it to me when i was in the helpless situation. After hearing this i pull her and gave a tight hug during that time my tears wet her shoulders. This is one of instance she inspired me lot....... I will not forget her timely and lovely help in my life span. \n\nI would like to thank god and my parents to bring such wondeful pair for me. Thanks.",

Since I met her, I’d not say there has been tremendous change in my life but I have become more responsible, caring and a better human being.\r\nThere are uncountable examples where she inspired me with her dedication. One of those – when she well managed her home, office & everything while her mother was suffering from cancer. Because of her sincere efforts, her mother survived for 10+ years. Another one, when she did to-and-fro for 1.5 years to manage both the families well, since her mother passed away. \r\nThere were situations when I had a bad day and she was the one helped me to get away with it. To be frank, I am kind of a person not everybody is comfortable with, however she has shown great adaptability and ensured my needs are never compromised with. \r\nTime has tested her but she has always proved mettle of her character. On this Women’s day, I thank God for bringing her to my life and wish her all the good times in life. Always her, Deepak.”\r\n",

Diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in Class 11, she did not let that hamper her and continued living life to the fullest. Despite being limited by her medical condition, she continued to be adventurous. From bike riding to adventure activities, she has done it all. \nHowever, when tragedy struck when she was in Berlin for work when her kidneys failed. Dialysis thrice-a-week was her only option. Coming from a middle-class background, the family finances were soon sapped and they had to sell everything and move to a remote location outside Mumbai. However, she continued to be undeterred and despite the odds, knew she wanted to fight. She signed up for the first ever Pancreatic transplant surgery in Mumbai and as she did not have the funds, appealed to people on crowd-funding platforms. \nHer journey has been fraught with difficulties but she has emerged victorious.

She was a writer, social activitist, first class magistrate and a dynamo who gave me courage to write, inspired me to get a scholarship to USA to study, made me fly a Pushpak, and made me learn the piano, dance and so much else. She herself won awards in her time that took her to USA in meetings with Eleanor Roosevelt, went with delegations to Russia, wrote short stories, poetry anthologies, novels, and revalued dozens of women's lives who came in touch with her. She gave my father full support in Rotary, in his career, in his embracing of Brahmoism. It was her broadmindedness, her deep seated values, her joie de vivre and love for enjoying all facets of life, infusing a sense of seeking all that is meaningful and beautiful in the cultural and societal milieu that has given me the will to keep going in my profession and in my varied interests.",

She has her setup at badabazr the business hub of Kolkata. Goes each day from her home to her work place from morning till late evening from the months of January to august and is free from work after Raksha Bandhan. Then after a few days break she again is preparing for next business year. I have often seen her playing card games on her laptop during her free from work months. Did  they had a computer education at their childhood ,I often wonder how did a non educated lady pick up computer skills. After getting primary Hindi medium education and being married off  at an early age she was unfortunate enough to lose her husband within few years of her marriage. The Rakhi business which started off as a necessity then is now a strength. Though both her sons and daughters in laws are earning well but she is not a bit dependent on them.  The period which is perhaps the dull season for her work she is seen socializing with her kirtan group and friends. She when sings bhajans leaves each one mesmerized.Such  soft voiced lady dealing with so many during her working days,I really think how? Such is her charm that I see my kids spending more time with her than they do with their own grandma. She deserves a big applause I feel this from the bottom of my heart.",

However, when Poonam Dalal Dahiya decided to clear the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) exam and join the Indian Revenue Service (IRS), she didn’t let motherhood or police duty stop her. So, what does it take to be like her?\n\nThe journey\n\nPoonam was born in a middle-class home in Jhajjar, Haryana. For a few years she donned different hats-a primary teacher in Delhi, a Probationary Officer at State Bank of India and even joined the Income Tax Department.\n\nThe idea of taking the UPSC exam came to her when she secured 7th rank in the SSC Graduate Level Examination. Poonam first attempted to clear the exam at the age of 28. At the time, she was already married to Asim Dahiya, who was employed in the Customs Excise Department.\n\nMeanwhile, she cleared the Haryana PSC exam and was recruited into the Haryana police as Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in 2011. That year, Poonam failed the UPSC prelims and had almost given up all hope.\n\nA turn of fate\n\nAfter her third attempt, Poonam reached an age that made it unable for her to retake the exam. However, a fortunate turn of events led the government to offer unsuccessful candidates yet another chance. “It felt like the whole universe was conspiring to make my dream come true,” she says. Poonam wanted to grab this unexpected opportunity, but by then she had a three-month-old baby who needed her attention. “I had to find a way to study, without letting my son or duty suffer because of it,” she adds.\n\nNot without my family\n\n“My father has been a big inspiration. He made sure I received a good formal education,” says Poonam. Hailing from a small village, Poonam’s parents always encouraged her to pursue her dreams. “I have two brothers, and both helped me study for the exam,” she adds.\n\n",

Born in a place where girls are just supposed to learn cooking and get married. I spent my nights studying, without any tuition and focusing only on my dreams. I worked through all the biggest challenges and fear that came up my way. The day I completed my education, I was selected in the top consultancy firms of the world. But I still remember the courage and effort which I put through to just make a name for myself in the society.",

        "description": "Being a woman is beautiful. And being a mother puts the whole world in perspective.” \n \nThis is true. The ideal, 24x7 example of inspiration, Mrs Bakhtawar Saini is the ‘woman next door’ who has been busy bending the rules. \n\nDirector-Operations at the Scottish High International School, Gurugram and mother to three adorable kids, Mrs Saini feels that motherhood is truly rewarding. It is mixed with challenges that make the reward even sweeter. \n\nHer challenges started when her son Ranveer, was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at the age of 2. As a child, Ranveer‘s growing years were accompanied by a lot of behavioural concerns, aggressiveness and hyperactivity, and it was becoming extremely challenging for her as a mother. She knew that she had a long journey ahead.\n \nHowever, she didn’t give up. As much as she wanted to help Ranveer cope up with his normal life, the social stigma of being the mother of an autistic child started alienating her from the rest of the world. But she kept going.\n \nA beam of comfort came through when one day she discovered Ranveer discovering Golf. It was a breakthrough for her. Ranveer found recreation in golf. Fumbling and taking his chances at the Golf course. It seemed that he had found a spot where he could be all by himself. \n\nBut it was not that simple. Golf required long hours of attention, focus and hours of sustaining the game and it was going all against Ranveer’s disability. However, she was unrelenting. Every day, she would take Ranveer to the Golf course and sit for hours, watching him struggle to make things work. And finally, it did.\n \nToday Ranveer is the first Indian to create history by winning a Gold medal in Special Olympics, World Games, LA, 2015, followed by a Silver medal in Special Olympics, World Games, Abu Dhabi-2019. He is the Limca Record holder - 4 years in a row (2014-17) & recipient of the Bhim Award, and many more. \n\nTruly Mrs Saini is a brilliant example of victories over challenges! \n",

The gracious lady who has managed to inspire me since my day 1 at earth - my mother/mom/ma! I have always wondered what a superhero she has managed to be through all these years. My mother lost her mother when she was in class X and early on she started playing the role of a care taker for her siblings, manager of household and was studying to make a career.She started teaching at Adult Education in rural areas, post completing her B.Ed. in 1976. As a part of her job, she had to travel to distant remote (rural) locations using public transport irrespective of timings of the day. That is extremely courageous! She got married in 1982 and I was born to her after 8 years (and several medical complications) of her marriage to my father. \nSince my birth,I haven’t seen a day when she had left a stone unturned to provide me with loving, protected and disciplined surroundings. Now, she is retired and happily managing her home. However, her dream of owning her “home” and a “car” is still unfulfilled due to stressed financial situation of the family. Her health has deteriorated due the kind of physical hard work she did during her younger years. She is suffering from psoriasis, arthritis and spondylitis at the moment and has become quite weak. However, she is still gleaming with goodness, kindness and the first one to offer help when someone needs it. ❤ \nShe is an angel in real life because I have always seen her strong, smiling and full of life. She has faced a lot of hardships and challenges at different stages of life but I have never seen her down and low. She has taught me to be a fighter, be strong willed and follow my heart always. My heart is filled with joy while writing this excerpt and I cannot have enough words/space to describe her full-life story in one go. She is my love, light and the personification of God on earth. SHE deserves to be celebrated! ",

In 2015, she became the first female Indian tennis player who gained the number one position in doubles, beating Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci from Italy. Her success story is one which is driven by consistent passion, hard-work, unstinted commitment and dedication. A sports prodigy who began playing the sport at the age of five, she hasn’t ever missed her routine training sessions for twenty-three years.\r\n\r\nSaniaMirza’s success story has also been besotted by troubles of a different kind – for instance, being a Muslim, the so-called ‘upholders’ of morality posited that it is a matter of shame for her to wear skirts and expose her legs in front of the whole world, or specifically, in front of strange men. Secondly, her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer Shoaib also drew a lot of flak from the general public. Her decision to marry early was condemned, overlooking the fact that it is only her right to decide such issues. Additionally, it was rumoured that she would now play for Pakistan, since she had married a Pakistani national. Despite all such baseless, distractive accusations and remarks, Sania has never been bogged down.\r\n\r\nShe has always concentrated on her game, in a truly professional manner. Her biggest source of support has been her family, as his evident from the fact that it was her father who had begun training her at the tender age of five or six. Her family did not hesitate to drive across state boundaries in a car to enable their daughter to participate in tennis tournaments.\r\n\r\n Also, her own determination and grit in the face of all adversity has gained international recognition – she is the UN Women’s Goodwill Ambassador for South Asia. Her name also features in one of the fifty heroes of Asia – a list released by Time magazine.",

It is probably that curiosity that made me become a chemical engineer turned marketing professional turned author and finally a full time entrepreneur.  Dwelling into content and branding has made me all the more open and free to suggestions, opinions and criticism.\n\nSince the past few years, I have not been worrying about the next step.  In case I feel I need to do something, I just go for it.  I am proud to say that I am POSITIVE ENERGY that has taken a human form.\n\nI have this perennial thirst for knowledge.  Last year I read 52 books, designed my tattoo, expanded my business “The Writers’ Junction” , a branding and content platform and delivered numerous talks and sessions.  People are generally very curious about the concept behind my tattoo.  It’s something that I have wanted, for a while now. The idea and concept was mine.

The manufactured equipment was lying in our factory, and the customers were dithering to pick-up the ordered goods. What might have been normal for large businesses, became a matter of grave concern for my father’s then-fledgling company. There were vendors that needed to be paid and we didn’t even have any money for personal expenses. I was 12 and very scared. We constantly received angry calls from vendors at home and with my dad frequently traveling to sort out customer-issues, somebody was required to step-up to help with this unravelling chaos. That somebody was my mom, a housewife with zero business experience became the ad-hoc factory manager to manage this crisis. In those days, she would wake up at 5 AM – prepare breakfast and lunch for everyone, get ready, change 3 rickshaws (8-9 people crammed in a single tuk-tuk) to save travel cost, be at the factory the whole day – a single lady amidst ten men which included the contract labor staff, come back home everyday at 7 in the evening and prepare dinner for everyone. She ensured that we adapted our lifestyle to our changing financial condition. She would drive hard bargains with kirana store-owners and vegetable vendors, find out all about discounts and sources where we would get things cheaper, and walked a lot (she used to wear crepe bandages around her feet to reduce the pain)! She ran the ship with a tight budget and ensured that our bellies were warm and filled. It was a hard life, and everyone of us worked harder. But none, more than my mom! In a few years the situation eased out but the lessons my mom taught me, helped me in becoming a better person today. She taught me how to bargain hard, she pushed me to work harder and she ensured that I participate in each competition that came across in school or college. She has always inspired me and inculcated this very vital lesson in me: Winning is not important, participating is!\n",

She says “never pray to god to get one thing or the other rather always pray to make yourself so competent that you are always giving to others”. she has always encouraged me to give as much help to the needy as you can. She is full of compassion and never hesitates when it comes to giving. As she believes that “One who gets a lot from the world is a big man, but the one who gives to the world is bigger”. These words always remain with me and inspire me to give back more to the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a tragic demise of my first wife, Lalita came into my life. Our families got us together as she also lost her first husband. Although, she is 14 years younger to me, she is much wiser than I am. She has worked hard to achieve a lot in life and further encourages me, even in this old age, to be progressive in life.  She worked relentlessly to keep the synergies of the family together by taking care of all our 5 children(from previous marriages). It is magical that there exists no difference among them. They love and care for each other. It is my wife who helped us all to bind together. Not only this she believes in giving and says “One who gets a lot from the world is a big man, but the one who gives back to the world is bigger”. These words of my wife always inspire me to give back more to the world.",

And they stand apt for the woman whose story I am about to share \r\n- the woman I love, admire and take strength from  - my wife Lakshita. \r\nShe has been a strong pillar of support, especially pertaining to my profession where I have to be away from home for long periods of time. She has stood by me through thick and thin.\r\nI am a Captain in the Merchant Navy. My wife was working as a Mathematics teacher in a highly reputed school in Delhi before we got married.\r\nAfter our marriage, she quit her job so that we could be together and start a family. She decided to accompany me on my ship and we started sailing together on board for very long periods of time without having the luxury of normal day to day things, which we realize the absence of more, like talking to your family, going out with friends , have unrestricted internet etc...The list is enormous.\r\nLife has been an adventure ever since and we managed to travel and explore all seven continents together in the last decade.\r\nShe has always smilingly and willingly sailed with me on ship even though we faced extreme violent weather conditions and storms, hurricanes and typhoons where the ship was being tossed around the ocean waves like a toy. We also survived a piracy attack off the coast of Somalia when the vessel was attacked by armed pirates.\r\nShe had the courage and the strength to go through it and even now the beautiful journey  that we share is because of her constant endeavors for us to be together. \r\nAs she always says - Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away...",

I am only a housewife, just a housewife.\r\n       Like all women, I did household chores working from early morning till night. Whole family took me forgranteed as if I am a maid, a free maid, a permanent maid.They ignored my whole day hard work and pointed only left ones. Something was now killing me inside. I felt exhausted as if it has drained me of everything that i had. I am tired of being unappreciated..\r\n     I had two possibilities : either to repent on present situation by comparing my current self with the best I have been ( lecturer in college nd artist/writer by hobby) or to make best of the situation to be happy. Then came the stage of realization. Sometimes, a little change is good thing. One can change ones life by changing one's thinking.  I changed overnight. I took a deep breath and had affirmation that everything is best. I took my home making as God given gift. I started saying..\r\nI m a super woman, super wife, super daughter in law nd a super mom!!  I am the best.\r\nTruly, change your thoughts and you will change your world. Now I see myself as a strong pillar of house without whom whole family will shatter in pieces. My kids are best in  studies and cocurricular activities all due to my teaching and hard Work. When they win, its my victory. When my in laws are not well I take care of them as a nurse. Their health is my wealth. I maintain home nd take care of my hubby. I never go extravagant by joining kitties or doing parties in club. I save hard earned money. In return I get what I desire without even uttering.He persuaded to give sometime to myself too, to my hobby nd to my passion of art , craft nd writing. Because of his support my story book  Uljhan Rishton Ki  is published. My art and craft is gaining applause everywhere.

        "description": "Whenever I could think of a woman that inspired us in all walks of our life, I immediately think of my Mother. My life has been a roller-coaster ride of ups and downs. The untimely death of my father when I was 13 years old caused us great distress. My mother was working as a Government Servant, had already completed 25 years of her service by then. She rented a 1RK place and me, my mother & elder sister started our new life after my father’s demise.\nMom always worked hard and provided us everything she could. I don't think we even asked for a lot of 'things' when we were growing up. And even if we did, it never occurred to us that in that moment mom was probably giving up something she really wanted or needed for herself just, so I could have something I wanted. She would never show that as a burden though. \nI could get my Computer Engineering degree just because she taught us to be focused on our career. The 3 years Engineering fee was something we couldn’t afford but we took a Student loan which made it easier to get what I needed. While sister completed her education and was doing a full-time job to support our family.\nBy this time, my mother and sister had gone through a life-altering accident from which mom’s recovery had took almost a year. Since mom was a Government Servant, she re-joined but had to travel too far daily. The commute was difficult. The journey took 2 hours one way, state transport buses had no good suspensions which led her to have another operation for slip disk. But she never gave up & fought back. \nI remember when mom was in the hospital after her major accident, doctors thought she wouldn’t survive. But “Wheel-power” it was that made her recover & be an example of how one could fight back with life. We were astounded every time mom took things in her hand and came back as a fighter, winner, champion. A grand salute to her “Wheel-power”! Thank you mom for always being there in our life & know that I love you and cherish you more than life.",

        "description": "About 10 million people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) fled the country and took refuge in India after Partition. Among the migrants, were my maternal and paternal grandparents. They were left homeless and traveled to unknown destinations to build a new life, not because they wanted to, but because they were forced to do and they had no choice left for themselves. \nShishu, adorably called Manu was born on 5th of June 1947. She was the eldest of the four siblings. Dr. Haripada Halder , an Ayurvedic doctor by profession had a flourishing practice in Barisal district (a town in Bangladesh). However, Post Partition things started changing drastically. Hindu houses were plundered and burnt. Women were molested, raped and many murdered. Seeing conditions worsening day by day, in 1958, Dr. Halder decided to leave the country with his family. They crossed Petropole, and travelled to Sealdah Railway Station (India) bare-handed and bare-footed. After spending eleven days in make shift tents on the Railway Platform, they were sent to Refugee Camps in North Bihar. Life was hard for the distraught family to adjust to a new land and start afresh without financial resources. Mother Belaka, Manu and her eldest brother started making “bidi” to add to earnings. Dr. Halder struggled to establish his practice. Soon, he regained his prosperity as a skilled physician. Things started improving gradually. Shishu continued with her studies, and was the first girl in the Camp to complete her Matriculation in 1962. She did her Graduation and was selected as Welfare Officer by the Bihar Govt. in 1967. Later, she joined Indian Oil Corporation in 1973.\nMy mother is a woman of substance. She has brilliantly managed and excelled in her job and family responsibilities. It’s because of her noble parenting, today, I and my sister, both are academicians and pursuing our career successfully. Lucky, I am to have her in my life and wish that, I was born in her womb again for my next re-births!!",

These were devotedly enforced by my sister, being dedicated and passionate about integrity  in family and in career advancements; ‘virtues’ rarely visible currently.  Family economics deprived me of regular Post Matric studies. Undeterred, I completed my Graduation, LL.B., Management studies while learning and earning for parents, brothers and sisters.

I worked as ‘Post man’, ‘clerk’, a ‘typist’, Assistant, Sr. Assistant, officer, Dy. Manager, Manager, Sr. Manager, Dy. General Manager, Additional General Manager, got fellowships from UK and Denmark Governments and finally superannuated as General Manager;  getting elevations in a zig zag way by changing one company and the other, – approximately a dozen. And still at young age of 77, I continue to hunt for fruitful engagements.  My hunt does chip in a few thousands though on short time assignments.   \nAll these elevations were not ‘simple’; rather earned after a long list of struggles facing ‘unethical’ persons, political leaders and other miscreants. a.\tOnce advised a trade unionist to be punctual in attending office, three to four cops from Delhi Police suddenly came to office and showed me a couple of  complaints from two MPs then; one sitting and the other ‘formerly’ accusing me of amassing wealth in recruitment and giving shelter to Sikh terrorists way back late in 1980s/1990s. \nOne cop from Ghaziabad too came asking me to accompany him which I resisted that he should approach the Chief Vigilance Officer of our Company since I can’t leave Hqrs without his permission.

I went around to meet many Homoeopathic doctors for their guidance and help, to my utter disappointment they all refused..  this was the time my aunt introduced me to a Doctor from mumbai.. Dr Anjali Tayle.. as my aunt was her patient.. my aunt had told Dr Tayde about me and my delima.. As i called her and asked her whether i could just sit in her clinic with her and observe her cases.. without a second she said Yes Raja you come.. she had this habit making people comfortable by speaking to them so politely.. i packed my bags n next day i left for mumbai.. \nI went to see her.. and she asked me to sit with her and observe her cases.. \nThe thing that i liked about her was.. her godly attitude of helping others! When in need she was the one who came to my rescue.. even though i was a stranger to her.. and her help was selfless!  He motivated me alot.. in many ways.. she gave courage.. to start my clinic.. i observed her .. she is a lady with a lot of positive energy and she spreads this positive energy to the ones who surround her.. she gives hope to people..as she is a Homoeopathic doctor..many people came to her for counseling.. and she solved their cases and consoled them beautifully.. all her patients left the clinic with a smilie on their face.. \nWhat i also loved about her is.. in todays world where everyone thinks only about themselves..and keeps all secrets.. she was exactly opposite.. she never kept anything hidden.. she gave advise without any inhibitions.. n spead a lot of love and hope.. she inspires people to follow their passion.. she herself loves making utility bags.. and has a separate business of that.she also is a good mother and good cook too. i would just say that like me there will so many people that she must inspired and spread her magic!",

She has always given more than 100% to educate us, to stand us on our own feet. After getting married in a small village where she had to do all the household cores alone for a big family of 12 persons that too by keeping a veil from all the elder males, she had almost forgotten herself. Side by side she was also giving tutions to 3 of us. She was a pampered child who had never touched any household core before marriage. The way she has suffered throughout her life has made her a strong person. I had seen her crying, being scolded from my great grandmother. I had seen us in depression. All I regret is that I could not save her from this suffering. I owe my life to her. It is her hardwork that has made us stand on our feet today. Words are not enough to describe her sacrifices.

Being a single mother, she did many jobs to earn money for my medical expenses, education, food, etc. And I request every children to take care of their mother once they grown up. Because that is the only chance for us to make our mother happy. ",

She makes me realise about the beautiful nature we have and how we are destroying it. She is from Kalimpong ( Darjling ) and she is living in nature since her birth. I am from Gurgaon where pollution is a problem. We had a arrange marriage. She encourages me to plant more & more trees in our surrounding. We both have planted 10 trees this monsoon season and teaching my only kid to how to love nature. She also focuses on water saving. Earlier i used shower for bath, now i use bucket. Saving water purifier water for different use & use bucket for car washing. Small steps but our small contribution towards our Mother Nature. Even she aware people ( her friends, officemates, realtives ) about benefits of having trees and water saving. \r\nI am learning a lot from her and spreading the good deeds among people . \r\nLove our Mother Earth. She is giving life to us. No luxury can buy you clean water and pure air, but Mother Earth is giving you it free of cost. Her words.\r\nShe is my wife, my better half & my love.\r\n",

My mother always fulfilled every demand of mine the time i pointed finger on a particular thing may that was possible for her to get, she got me on the second second.

She was extremely depressed and even tried to commit suicide twice, but failed. She is extremely soft spoken and a wonderful lady with extreme talent of art work. So when we got to know all this, all we friends forced her to do a job so that atleast her mind gets distracted from her home issues. So she joined a advertising agency where she used her creativity and its been 4 years now. Shes earning extremely well, shes independent and most importantly she's happily divorsed and living her life with her 4 years old daughter. She recently moved to Mumbai and shes the most happiest women and I'm proud to be a part of her life. She has inspired us all and specially my own sister. As dad never allowed her to move out of the city and be her ownself. So she took a stand left her job here in Amritsar and moved to delhi to live her dreams. She always wanted to be a writer, which dad never encouraged. So now after 2 years my sister is a successful content writer and shes living her dream she always wanted to.",

Our relationship seems to uncover new, and unexplored, areas of who we are as individuals and who we are as a married couple. Throughout the twists and turns of the voyage of marriage, I have observed who I have become up till now through everything and it has made me see how much my wife inspires me to love, be joyful, and to create.\n\nLoving Unconditionally\nMy wife inspires me to love very deeply. Her love is strong. Even saying that is understatement, but it is true. Her love for me is a strong force that is constantly going deeper to where it reflects a love of a divine savior; it is unavoidable and unstoppable. There have been times where anger and self-pity twisted and rooted far and wide inside of me giving birth to children of hate and spite. I become a dark, frustrated, and vile person to where being near me brings my wife to tears or resentment; but amazingly, throughout the ridiculous mess–she chooses to love me. Her love doesn‘t draw away or turn into violent action. It remains strong; and even through there might be tears and pain, it never backs down; leaving me, eventually, with no choice but to love back.\n\nSurprising Joy\nSimilar to my wife‘s love is her inspirational ability to shine with joy. It is hard for me to go a day without smiling because of something my wife has said or done; and if you knew how hard it is for me to go a day without feeling heavy amounts of negativity then this amazing. Ginnie sees the life around her with such beauty that her actions and words involved in our relationship are colored with bright tones of joy. It takes me by surprise sometimes, as I am someone who gets lost in an un-joyful state; but no matter what, the light that is reflected from her joy eventually breaks through into my heart and brings in a warmer mindset of the life around me.\nCreativity To Share\nCombined with ",

        "description": "My mother inspires me every single day. I know you may think this is cliche, but wait, let me explain why.  Ayesha has been both a mother and a father to my brother and when our father didn’t really want us or want to take care of us. She’s never made us feel like we are inferior or that we lack something or someone in our life. She’s extraordinary because while her parents disowned her for marrying a man of her choice, a man out of her religion, she chose to live by her choices, unapologetically. See she was born into a conservative Hindu family and fell in love with my father, who was born in a Muslim family. When the marriage didn’t work out and my father didn’t really want to stay involved, my mother stepped up. She became both our father and our mother. She’s been our guide and our confidante. Imagine being disowned by your parents, going through a divorce and being left with two very young impressionable children. They say the children of divorced parents may end up exhibiting signs of trauma for their whole lives. Not with my mother around, no. She made sure we weren’t a stereotype. She worked multiple jobs, saved up, sacrificed a lot so that her two children can be educated and brought up without obstacles. So that no one would point fingers at us and call us fatherless. I know all mothers are selfless but this lady does the job of two parents in one. She got me married single handedly and helped my brother with his basketball goals. She taught me how to drive and him how to cook. It’s not easy to fight patriarchy, your husband and your parents to bring up your children in this world alone and she continues this fight for us every single day. We’ve never felt the hardships of single parenthood because she’s never let us. I know there may be many stories like this but no one is like my mother. When I have children, I hope I am even 1/4th the mother she is. She’s an extraordinary human being and her story is an exceptional case of growth, strength and love. ",

All that she was best at was household shores. Life took a sudden flip, the only support and trust to her, the husband died. She was left with a daughter who was just a year old and a cruel world to face. \nIt was her spirt, which said she needs to make sure that the daughter gets her best chance. She took over from where ever the shores were left unfinished. \nShe studied , took a job and started working for Ministry of Defence (DRDO). Not only did she look after her daughter but also took care of her demised husband's mother. \nDespite the hard ship and no support, she has eventually raised her daughter independent and a lawyer.\nWhat I admire more about her is that not only did she improved the life of others, she did it for herself as well.  It needs a lot of guts to get remarried at the age of 55+ , to find a companion. \nAnd you know what she inspire with the fact that no matter what you face in life .... You learn and if you have the guts to conquer, you will! I am proud to say that I am honoured enough to call this women my MOTHER!",

        "description": "Ruchika saini is my beloved  wife. We married last year in December, she is a true inspiration for me, she believed in me when I m nothing and now I am successful only because of her inspiration. Actually it all started in April 2017 when her parents first come to our house but they rejected me because at that time we are live in a rented house and I doing contractual work on day to day basis. At that time I believe they are right but God has written something different for us . We again met in August 2017, we started talking to each other, she has shown interest in me, she believes in me. We decided to get engage and her trust on me let me believe in myself. I started working very hard after my engagement. I cleared a exam for government job. Now I am government teacher and in our society teacher's job is a good reputed job. Her trust and believe in me allow me to work hard and today we are a happily married couple. Thank you Ruchika for the support ",

        "description": " Kiran Bedi is truly an icon of heroism. She was the first Indian woman to join the Indian Police Services. She was born on June 9, 1949 at Amritsar in Punjab. She is one of the most renowned police officers, who have put in their whole hearted effort in serving the society,,\r\nShe has also been the Lieutenant Governor of Chandigarh and Director General of Narcotics Control Bureau. An interesting thing about Kiran Bedi is that, sometimes, she is referred to as Crane Bedi. The reason behind calling her by this name is that, she dragged the car of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi due to violation of parking rules. \r\n\r\nKiran Bedi made the Indian Police Service change its decision in matters related to traffic management, control over narcotics and VIP security. During her tenure as the Inspector General of Tihar Jail, she brought about several reforms in the way the prisons are managed. She brought forth a number of measures like yoga, meditation, redressal of complaints made by the prisoners etc. ",

And she always came bearing toys , balloons ,pens . And our afternoon naps were the times when she used to catch up on me what I did in the morning how I played that day etc etc. But now when I think of those times all remember is that she tried everything she could . She worked so that we could get a better future . She worked even when she wasn't feeling well . She always stood up for her so that we can understand how  important it is to have own identity . She did both her jobs well . She took care of us while working. She always inspired us to be more and do more. She always insist on educating ourselves. Because she's seen difficult times while she was younger. She used to work for her fee and then study . She worked so hard to get her degrees and job. And now l can understand her better and respect her even more. And love her even more. She's the backbone of my home. Our strength. ",

Even regular taxi drivers We met along the way were amazed by her knowledge of vehicle and her driving skills.\r\nSkills apart her day to day life has been a journey since she got married. She is born &  brought up in city and married in small town of Himachal. Initially it was very tough for her but eventually she got use to the environment. She was working before marriage but after marriage she could not continue for various reasons. She started intraday trading with me, what I use to do for killing some time while at home. Being a sailor wife most of time she is alone(without me). She learned nitty & gritties of tradiy so well that she is considered successful trader now. I also have second career option now and I can earn while I am with her. She learnt it so passionately in order to keep us together. She has been an inspiration all over, a loveable wife, supereb daughter & daughter in law and great human being.\r\n\r\nRgds\r\nVikas",

I got to know the challenges that female associates face everyday starting from commuting to office in shared cabs , cooking lunch/dinner etc and then bare the heat of professional environment.\r\nOne of the associate,Monika Gupta, was a new joiner to my company and project and was suffering through many diseases and had a turmoil personal life but to my surprise, her health and personal issues never stopped her from doing her work with perfection. She was just into first year of her professional journey but was way ahead of her superior. Her preservance, dedication , diligence and never say no attitude were some of her stand-out attributes.\r\nAt that point in time, I was at a very crucial juncture of my professional career where-in I was trying to settle into managerial role and become people’s manager and I feel very fortunate to have her in my Team because she inspired me to be sensitive to Team Member’s aspiration , their personal hurdles and that continues to help me even today when I manage new Team in different accounts and projects.",

        "description": "In simple words I would express the story of my mother from whom I learnt to be bold and brave in any circumstances that life pushes to.  Living lavishly in Mumbai she married to a man who was well settled then.  Later on due to the family issues they were separated from the family and they began living together. As days passed by the man[my father ] became an alcoholic. He left his job and started boozing limitless. When he lost all his money,  he kept stealing gold from home to keep up the money for his drinking. Thus we lost everything we had . There where days when dad used to not come home for weeks together and me and mom searching for him in rickshaw stands,  petrol pumps etc. I was bullied in the school for all this. I didn't have food for weeks together. People kept telling my mom keep your daughter in boarding school and go abroad and live your life. But my mom was strong enough. She decided to live with her husband no matter what.  She completed her Montessori course from Bangalore and began teaching to support our family. She kept giving tuitions after her classes. Meanwhile I used to stay by the shop nearby no matter what the weather was. The sunlight,  heavy rains, splash of water from puddles by those cars etc.  I faced everything waiting for mom to return after tuitions. My relatives kept coming to the same shop where I used to sit. They ate drank kept buying stuffs to eat but they didn't  even bother to ask if I've eaten anything. My uncle smoked in front of me took food stuffs for his son leaving me unnoticed. At the same time mom also faced all the criticism and harsh words from people around. But my mom was brave enough to move forward in life. Finally when dad had almost lost everything and had planned to commit suicide he left the house in the midnight and never returned for a week. We kept searching for him and finally found him in front of a church in mangalore. He was put in a de addiction center. Mom forgived him. ",

Studied upto 4th class become school dropout. Her parents married her to a Rich Patil family of neatest village Tadkal, thought that she will be happy through out her life. But the reality is different then. Even to have food they have to wait until her father-in-law finishes first. Her father-in-law in-law never allowed her to step out of his home except once in a year for Diwali celebration in her mother home. She raised three of her Husband’s brothers with at most care, affection and motherly love. But after death of her father-in-law her Husband’s have tortured her like anything by not allowing to take care of her 4 children. They maid her to prepare food for all family members until 1pm everyday. Even for basic needs she has to beg in front of her husband’s brother because her husband is illiterate, hardworking, villager. This has not stopped her in nourishments of her children’s with limited resource. Today she has given a great soldier to India serving in J & K. Younger son as Engineer and two daughters as business womens. \r\nOne instance I want convey that she had ear problems in her early age she has to for 4 decades just to get operated from her sons earnings. She is well know in Tadakal village for her sacrifices for her family. Who had tortured her are now facing sufferings from god and regretting for their past acts. I thank god wholeheartedly for giving her as mother in this life. \r\nShe is the greatest source of inspiration to me in all paths of my life. Thank You mother Shalubai. ",

Because every minute counts in the morning and the attempt to win over unlimited chores of making breakfast, getting others ready, dropping children to school and so on.\r\nIt's not easy to dedicate your life to the happiness of others. It also needs courage and love to serve others for life with no expectations. So let’s appreciate the building blocks of every home for a minute, for a second if possible. ",

She is the only woman to become World Amateur Boxing champion for a record six times  and have won a medal in each one of the seven world championships. She belong from poor family. Kom grew up and helping her parents with farm related chores, going to school and learning athletics initially and later boxing simultaneously. Mary Kom completed eight years of education in Moirang and proceeded to Imphal for her ninth and tenth standards. Unfortunately, she could not pass her examinations. So, she quit school and gave her examination from NIOS and graduated from Churachandpur College. Although she was not brilliant academically, she did not give up on life. Not everyone is good at studies; some are good at sports. She is inspired me a lot because  be a successful boxer one must also have a strong heart. Some women are physically strong but fail when it comes to having a strong heart. One also must have the zeal and the right fighting spirit. We work harder than men and are determined to fight with all our strength to make our nation. From young, Mary Kom was interested in athletics, but the success of Dingko Singh, an Indian boxer born in Manipur. Just like Mary Kom, we have role models of our own and we look up to them. When they achieve great things in life, we are inspired to follow in their footsteps, and this is what Mary Kom did. Her story inspired me and all youngster beacuse we know that boxing is considered unsuitable for women but Mary Kom did that role. Many of the youngsters today are afraid to pursue their dreams; they are afraid of rejections from the society. Success can never materialise from fear. For success, one needs to be confident and determined. If you are certain about your goals and youryou should take up the challenge and pursue them. Only then will you be able to reach the peak of success.Mary Kom proved to the world that age is nothing but a number.",

Inspiration is something which you adhere from people's story and one such comes from my mom.\nAt a small age she got married with humongous wings of dream which always motivated her to chase it. She was educated and wanted to get educated more, but due to family needs she had to be in home. Days after days passed by but she stood strong and inclined towards the goal. Despite my father and Grandpa had supported her strongly it was the true dedication and strong will she made to the top and now she got the doctrate to work for a noble profession that is teaching. Her hardwork and dedication towards work and ofcourse the intense care she gives to the family made me inspired and I hope one day I can be like her. Thank you...",

My mother is very intelligent and she is very enthusiastic. She always teach me very nicely. She has shown me excellent judgment and decision. My mom taught me my worth as a person. I've learned not to waste my time on people that don't treat me right. She doesn't let people walk all over her, and I've taken that lesson to heart. She has shown me resilience and strength. she is always there in all my phases of life. She is a fighter who never gives up, no matter how hard it gets. I am probably biased, but my mom is the most amazing woman I know. Not just as a mom, but as a person. She shows unbelievable determination and always has a goal in mind. Her life isn't always all business though. Her sense of humor will leave you giggling and she can always have a good time. She gives great advice and is there when someone needs a friend. I've seen her go out of her way to make someone's day, and expect nothing in return. My mother is the perfect example of what I aspire to be. she is very kind and has a great personality. she is very good in cooking, playing and studying. I have never seen such a enthusiastic person. she is the most inspirational women. I want to be like her. ",

The 68-year-old has raised over 1,400 orphans, offering them not just food and shelter, but also the love of a real family. Her amazing work has earned her over 750 awards, and the nickname “Mother of Orphans”.\r\n\r\n\r\nSapkal runs four orphanages in her home town of Prune, India’s Maharashtra state – two for girls and two for boys – with the help of her biological daughter, Mamta, and her eldest adopted children, some of whom have become lawyers, doctors and professors. The children under her care were found trying to fend for themselves in railway station, abandoned in dustbins, or even dragged by stray dogs in the streets. New ones are brought to her orphanages all the time, and as long as they are eligible for adoption, she never turns them away. But unlike state-run orphanages, the Mother of Orphans doesn’t give her children up for adoption with other families, and doesn’t turn them away when they turn 18.\r\n\r\n",

Her family financial statements were not good so that they both(she & her brother) didn't get a chance to go to good schools. So their parents chosen government school for them, they both done their schooling from government school but she was brilliant and had many dreams too. So her father given her freedom to do whatever she want. She was very laborious and she had given many exams and finally cracked the one and got admission in reputated government college where she paid her college fee by teaching school going children. She didn't take a single rupee from her home. Afterwards, she got a placement in a very good MNC company because of her talent and they were ready to pay her a big amount after seeing her intelligence and she joined. Then after her father never pulled a rickshaw, her mother is fit n fine. She bought a new house for them in the same city where she spent her childhood, her brother is also helping her father in his business. This is not the end, later on, 2 years before she got a call from foreign country to join their company and offered a huge amount. Nowadays She is working with that company and the most important part is that she is only 29. She never gave up that's the beauty of her.",

        "description": "she along with her sisters of the Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of love, care and compassion for the world. Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, known the world over as Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-born Indian citizen who abided by her religious faith of Roman Catholicism to serve the unwanted, unloved and uncared people of the world. One of the greatest humanitarians of the 20th century, she led all her life serving the poorest of the poor. She was a ray of hope for many, including the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families. Blessed with profound empathy, unwavering commitment and unshakable faith since young, she turned her back to the worldly pleasures and focussed on serving the mankind ever since she was 18. After years of service as a teacher and mentor, Mother Teresa experienced a call within her religious call, which changed her course of life completely, making her what she is known as today. Founder of the Missionaries of Charity, with her fervent commitment and incredible organizational and managerial skills, she developed an international organization that aimed towards helping the impoverished. For her service to the humanity she was honoured with Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. She was canonised by Pope Francis on 4 September 2016",

I wish I can be at least 20% of her, trust me. I try a lot to become like her, but I lose my control every time.\n \nThroughout my childhood till date, I have seen her living in what she has, giving the best to her kids, complaining about nothing…this list can go on and on. But what makes my mother stand out from others and make her my inspiration is she has never quit in her life.\n \nWe are four siblings; three sisters and a brother. My father used to earn hardly 5K, and there was no other financial support for my mother to raise us and give us a good lifestyle, instead, I can say an excellent education for a bright future. Let me tell you, running the house and educating 4 kids in just five thousand is a very critical job, but my mother did that without any complaint.\n \nEven today, when we all are grown up, she is still there for us, especially me. Whenever I feel low, I call her and tell her everything, and somehow she manages to handle the most complicated situation so easily.\n \nToday, we four are well-educated, earning well in our life, my two sisters are married, and yeah this all was possible because of my mom. I don’t know how did she manage, but I owe her everything. I try to make her proud every day.\n \nMassive respect and love for MOM.\n \nWho said being a housewife is an easy job, I am working now, but I feel the struggle, adjustment, and compromises my mother has made being a housewife I am far away from it.\n \nSalute to all the housewives there who are doing a great job every day without any weekly off.",

I loved my child but had a hard time liking my fussy baby. I was overly anxious and can’t relax,so I also cried along with her. That night was a nightmare for me.\nStruggling mama I thought my experience of motherhood in the first few months was a taste of what my entire life was going to feel like hence forth.I  wish I could enjoy initial days of my baby.\n But gradually I learnt how to handle her and started taking care of her it.now my husband is in abroad for a year and I have also rejoined my job.Managing both my work and baby perfectly.

Its a bit long since so many things happened with her that I couldn’t cut it short.\r\nI was very young, my dad was very well off but he used to drink day and night due to which he was always very aggressive and ruined all our lives. When my younger brother took birth the conditions even got worst because of his drinking habits and my grandparents were not at all supportive. Before 5th grade i changed my school 10 times because my dad used to kick us out of his house and my mom used to come to her native place to her parents. Me and my mom we together raised my brother, my father he never bothered about my brother. My mom was 29years when my dad passed away. Since my mom got married at very early age so she couldn’t complete her MA graduation. She didn’t get job anywhere. We did not know that my greedy grandparents took the advantage of my dad’s drinking and they had taken everything on their name from my dad. And my mom was left with nothing. Then all the relatives talked to them so they decided to give only Rs. 10,000 month out of the interest from my dad’s funds for all our education and household chores. We struggled a lot to survive. My grandparents and my bua used to abused my mom a lot. They used to throw money when my mom used to ask for and harassed her mentally. My bua(my father’s sister) she was my grandparents favorite so they used to favor her a lot. We never went anywhere on the trips when we were young. My maternal grandparents supported my mom emotionally a lot. But my maama g he never supported her. Nobody thought of getting my young mom remarried.\r\nI grew up doing engineering, got a job In Infosys. And my brother who was 7years younger to me, 3years back also started doing engineering in Sep 2015. But again god gave us set back giving shock of our lives when my mom lost his 18years son in an accident and i lost the best brother in this whole world. He was my mom’s last hope of happiness. She got devastated. She got so depres",

All parents and so students used to say mathematics is most difficult subject, I took it a challenge to make it interesting than difficult. From nursery education to doctorate I taught mathematics, but with experience realised that its not Mathematics students are looking to learn from me but life skill itself is more important. I took up as placement training head and later as Dean students welfare now. Working with parents, students and managers on counciling, making students to be better citizens than top rankers alone makes me enjoy my work evey day.

She was intelligent and  witty .She was likely to 16 or 18. She not from a very rich family but the  earning of the family was sufficient to feed themselves. Aditi had one elder brother. Unfortunately her mother, father as well as her brother suffered from Night blindness. She was the only in the family who did not have this disease. She was super in her studies and was super in her duties towards her family. She never cursed her fate and  loved her family.\nShe studied only in the night as  her family members suffered from Night blindness and  she was the only person who cooked the food, did the dishes, washed the clothes and took care of the cattles . She helped her mother before and after the school. She was very sincere for her school projects and completed the work always before time. Besides this  she even taught tution to the children of her neighbours and contributed to strengthen the financial condition of her family. She was the brightest student of her class and the beloved student of all the teachers.\n\nWhen the board exams of her 12 class arrived , she followed her daily routine as such but studied hard the whole night and prepared for her exams.\nIt was only due to her selfless struggle, devotion and hard work that she topped the state by obtaining 98.50% in medical field. She was offered for a scholarship by the Government , but she refused to accept it because she wanted to find the cure of the disease of \nNight blindness which the poor could afford.......\nThis is how Aditi Paul showed everyone that the devotion of a woman towards he work, is the most powerful weapon in this world.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "mother teresaMother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. Little is known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping the poor. At the age of 18, she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, with the Sisters of Loreto, she was then given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux – the patron saint of missionaries.\r\n\r\nOn her arrival in India, she began by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta made a deep impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective of this mission was to look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after. Mother Teresa felt that serving others was a fundamental principle of the teachings of Jesus Christ. She often mentioned the saying of Jesus,\r\n\r\n“Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, you do it to me.”\r\n\r\nAs Mother Teresa said herself:\r\n\r\n“Love cannot remain by itself – it has no meaning. Love has to be put into action, and that action is service .” – Mother Teresa\r\n\r\nmother-teresaShe experienced two particularly traumatic periods in Calcutta. The first was the Bengal famine of 1943 and the second was the Hindu/Muslim violence in 1946, before the partition of India. In 1948, she left the convent to live full-time among the poorest of Calcutta. She chose to wear a white Indian sari, with a blue border, out of respect for the traditional Indian dress. For many years, Mother Teresa and a small band of fellow nuns survived on minimal income and food, often having to beg for funds. But, slowly her efforts with the poorest were noted and appreciated by the local community and Indian politicians.\r\n\r\nIn 1952, she opened her first home for the dying, which allowed people to die with dignity. Mother Teresa often spent time with thos",

She also made her sister to marry her husband brother. But they made some fraud and took over the entire property. My mother in law was sad and afraid and so she went to another village. But my father in law could not bear that and died after one year and left 8 children alone. My mother in law did not lose the confidence even in the new place. She worked hard to grow educate and settle them with a job. I also did love marriage to her son and she and her daughters treated me like a queen. I also went to my mothers house for a small fight. My husband lost all his business because of me. but my mother in law patiently solved all the problem. Now I myself build a shop and house for my business and all that credit goes to my mother in law and sister in law. That's how she has inspired me",

I remember a small incident which taught me a big lesson of life 'Those were  days when i was in school (class 3) as i remember, i had a fight with my friend and i was very upset and i came home and started complaining every thing to my mother, I said nobody is good everything is bad, I hate everything i hate my friends and school all are bad . After few hours when i got calmed my mom brought a paper(on which a word map was drawn) and torn it into pieces  and then she asked me to fix the world map, after spending few hours i was unsuccessful, then my mom took those pieces and started to arrange that from back side of paper where a man was drawn, i was amazed to see that in few secs the world map was fixed, i asked mom how could she do it so fast and how  can i do it like her, she smiled and said as you could see there was a man drawn on back side of paper i simply fixed that man and the world is fixed. Similarly if you are good then the world will look good to you. No matter what your friend did to you or what all flaws your school had , you just try to give your best and things would be automatically sorted.' After that incident I started to stop complaining and take everything in a positive manner.She taught me not to blame others for your downfall but try to figure out what you can do to be best next time.",

Her father was against it, as after 10th standard she had to move to a different city for higher secondary education however  her mother supported her decision.\n\nWith her mother's support she eventually moved a new city for higher education. Where she had to cook her own food and stay and rented room with other girls and managing studies as well without family at a young age.. I could say that experience made her strong and independent woman.\n\nShe was intelligent and scored good marks in higher secondary and chose engineering field for further study. With the help of her maternal uncle she took study loan and self fun funded her studies as again this time too her father was completely reluctant to fund any fees for education and asked her to comeback to her hometown. \n\nSince she had strong desire for studies she finally chose the civil engineering branch  which is considered and male dominant engineering branch.With her mother blessings she stood top 10 students of her college in B.Tech and got top rank in M.Tech.\n\nAfter her completion of M.Tech is she got a good job offer from my city. After three months we finally met through online matrimony website. We liked each other and decided to get married.\n\nHere I forgot to mention that she had one of the conditions of marriage with me. She told  me that I will marry you if you support me in my Phd education :) which I accepted.\n\nAt present I am helping her to get admission in a reputed foreign universities for her PhD thesis.\n\nConclusion: Education gives you every attribute to become successful in your life.",

At school, one of our assignments was to collect newspaper cutouts and write an essay on her. She, unfortunately, passed away in the infamous Columbia disaster in 2003 at the early age of 42. On that mission, she worked as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator.\r\nIn 1994, the much-awaited dream was about to come true with NASA selecting Kalpana for astronaut training. She had to undergo evaluation for one year – an arduous process which required immense levels of fitness. Kalpana Chawla’s determination saw her through this rigorous training programme. In 1996, she was assigned the role of a mission specialist on STS-87 Columbia. In 1997, she finally realised her dream by being a part of a six-astronaut crew aboard the STS-87. Of her first trip to space, Kalpana said that sunrises and sunsets defined her experience in outer space. She yearned for a second chance and that came in 2003, when she was a part of the crew of STS-107, on a 16-day mission dedicated to science and research. On being selected again, she had then said, “Doing it again is like living a dream – a good dream – once again.” But, sadly, this time she went off on an eternal voyage to outer space, never to return.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land, but from the solar system.\r\n\r\n-Kalpana Chawla\r\n",

Become fluent in each of her “languages.”\r\nI love her from 11th standard.

        "description": "Today I am using this platform to write something about my mother. This is neither a story to inspire others nor she is a super woman. I believe you cannot inspire other until become successful, till then you are still a struggler. She is just a simple lady born in an Orthodox family. Her father married her at the age of 18 and she could not fulfill any of her dreams. When I (her daughter) came in her life, she has lots of dreams and expectations from her. Unluckily, my family (her in-laws) are Orthodox too. I too had dreams of studying from some nice college and get a good job so that I can fulfill her dreams and can make her feel proud. Whole family disagreed to sent me some other place to study and strictly against my job as they consider very bad instead of proud if a girl goes out of home and earns. But it was my mother only who fought with the whole family including my father and sent me for good education and job. She wants me to be Independent so that I can follow all my dreams which she could not.\n\nI just want to pass on the message to all the families though today everyone is busy in proving how modern they are and women tries to show off fake feminism. Not all girls wants to have night stays with friends, having boyfriends, wearing short clothes and dreams about rich husband. Some just wants to fulfill their dreams, wants to make their career. They want at least their parents to be with them in their career decision. Now with my  mother's blessing and God's grace I have not left my job and continuing it (right now from home only) and will never give up on my dreams. One day I will be definitely there where I always wanted to be and can make her feel proud. \nJust a question, forget about fake feminism,  Are we even allowed to take our decisions by ourself? Stop showing off how modern you are until you can listen to what your child wants. And girls, never stop dreaming and Stand for yourself if you know you can make it. My mom is my superhero :)",

        "description": "The woman who has inspired me the most is my first love, my mother. Her story starts as a 7 year old girl who is travelling back to her Village house on a horse Carriage. The carriage suddenly broke down and she, along with her mother (my Nani), her father (my Nana) 2 younger sisters and 2 younger brothers fell down. In this mishap her mother broke her left arm and got hit in the head. The blood clotted in her mother's head and  was admitted.  My Nani recovered soon but was unable to work. All the household responsibilities fell onto the little shoulders of my mother. She had to quit he school, stop her education. The tiny hands which were earlier used to play were suddenly burdened with house hold responsibilities. The school that she was still going into, to drop her brothers and sisters, seemed very far away. At an early age she got married to my father, and after a few years I was born. A few years past my father met an accident and broke his left leg, being a bus driver he could no longer go back to work. So, in order to meet day to day expenses my mother started working. I was kept at my Nani's house. She used to come every Sunday to meet me. This would obviously have been a very tough situation for her but she never gave up. In a few months every thingngot back to normal. When I was around 2-3 years old. My elder sister got blood cancer. Mom and dad tried their best in and out, spent every single penny they had, took loans, asked people for help. Even after doing all this, still, they couldn't save my sister and she died. There have been a lot of tough situations in my mom's life like my grandmother just before her death had huge medical problems, she couldn't even use the toilet and usually did her routines on the bed itself. But never did I see my mother getting upset or irritated about this. More over, mum was more concerned about bringing her into a healthy shape. \nAll such situations made me believe that she is the strongest women and I am really proud. ",

I find my life inspiring  because the situations could have sent me in depression .But not only i survived them, but i learnt to be a better person.I recognized my hidden talents and used them to face my life.I learnt to forget and forgive other's follies.My smile shows that life is not regretting about past but being optimistic  about future. Today my sons are well settled. We have built a new home and I am still teaching.And will continue to do so.I think that if I can do it,you can also do it.\r\nThank you.",

We used to talk and I came to know that she learned French at the age of 44 and did M.A in French. She said she had nothing to do at house and spent most of the years just like that. Her son asked her to learn something and she did that. And now she is a great French teacher. I was so inspired from her that I also learned French and now I am teaching the same. I came to know that age is not a limitation to learn or to do something. At any point of time you can do whatever you want, only if you are determined",

Since childhood and during her adulthood she was raised in a strict environment though after marriage she not only nourished, educated the children mostly on her own(since my father had a job out of the town for more than 10 years) but also inclucated strong values in all the 3 daugthers. I really admire her journey who was taught to be dependent to a strong woman who learned the things from challenges and a role model to all the three daughters.\n\nKudos to Bhawnaben :)",

In spite of being from a very backward village in Murshidabad WB , in spite of having no formal education or outside influence , she had a very modern outlook of Life. Luckily , she got married to a BRO soldier who catapulted her to a relatively modern life . She learnt quickly about the defence way of working, the chemistry of relationships between the surrounding groups et all. \r\nIn those days when people had 5 or 6 kids at a minimum, she stuck at one child and strictly said NO to another child in spite of huge societal pressures.\r\n At 20 years of  her age ,say around 56 years ago from today, she forced my father to take a big decision ,that is ,to construct a house for them. His salary was very less ,obviously, he was scared to start that venture. But her perseverance pulled him through and a house for us was made. I learnt from her that whatever happens, first try to get a roof over your head in your name. \r\nSecondly , when I was at a low point in my life, with a small child about to start school and my CA finals still pending ,I had almost given up on my career dreams . She was the one who stood before me like Maa Kali and exhorted me to leave everything behind ,even my husband ,my daughter and dedicate myself for one year to my Finals ,not even coming home for that one year ,she told me that Sadness is an Overrated emotion. \r\nInitially, I did not feel it is ok at all to leave everything and go far away for a year. Nevertheless, I gave it a try .\r\nAnd I succeeded. Now, I am a practicing Chartered Accountant and my daughter is a Doctor. My mother is a mother to both me and my daughter. We three are very close and friendly ......She stands as a Pillar for all three of us . My husband, my daughter and for myself ...",

        "description": "Most of the people consider that girls should not do job and at a certain and young age, they should get married and settled without having earnings and stand in their career. Fortunately, this story could be mine story but with the support of my leader and family, I achieved what I deserve. A happy IELTS and spoken English trainer with good reputation makes me feel good and satisfied. The main contribution was given by Mrs. Ashima.\r\n\r\nI first met her when she and her husband promoting BJP during the elections of 2014. At that time, I was studying in B.com in Govt P.G college and even struggling to support my family and meet my expenses where we were 4 members my parents, brother and me. My father is self employed and could not earn that much to fulfill our family needs and mother was also on shop to support my father where my brother was also not settled in his career and struggling. As I was living in Topkhana bazaar so there the financial resources were limited and family could not earn that much and due to that I felt undirected towards my career path. Surprisingly, in 2014, I went to her home for signing the document related with my college scholarship form. I got impressed at first sight with her motivational nature then I considered that she is the only one who can be my leader. I considered her for a leader because while we were having conversation, she told me her own story like how did she come to BJP where she was just a teacher and her husband used to do job and even more how before marriage she used to meet the financial requirements of her house. Then,I felt motivation inside me which I was lacking somewhere. Interestingly, I was selected among 30 women and I was the youngest one among them and that was pride for me and Mrs. Ashima and even our area too. After that, I taught there for 1 year. She already knew that it was just a small step so she guided me to give tuitions to local students. I became a successful IELTS trainer now all because of her. ",

However, this number doesn’t paint the correct picture as these incidences are just the ones wherein the victims registered reports against perpetrators.\r\n\r\nLaxmi Agarwal is one such victim of an acid attack which happened in 2015 in Delhi. At that time, Laxmi was a 15-year-old teenager. This unfortunate incident left her scarred – both physically and emotionally – for life. Not being the one to give up, she sought the support of many acid victims and filed a petition to curb acid sales in the Supreme Court of India.\r\n\r\nFor her commendable work in helping acid attack victims, Laxmi received the International Women of Courage Award from the then U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. Today, Chhanv Foundation – an NGO run by Laxmi - is the hope and voice of acid attack victims all over the world.",

She excels in whatever she does and balances her profession and home so well that it makes me think that how can she!! She's an wedding planner and a chairman of a organisation, an active member in her professional association committee and a great cook. I just get inspired from her everyday and lot of things i share to her about my problems and she gives a great solution for it. I get a lot of clarity about things when i talk about anything to her. She inspires a lot of them who she works with and they look upto her. She has uplifted a lot of young talent and made their career by the best she can for them and they can never be more thankful to her for this act of her's. ",

        "description": "It was in 1969, I got married abruptly  at the age of 20 ,while I was doing my MA at Allahabad University. My father had died a year earlier, hence my brothers hurried my marriage to get rid of their responsibilities. \r\nI was devastated leaving my studies midway. \r\nAt my in-laws place, I was taunted and ridiculed for not getting dowry. \r\nThen my first daughter was born within a year of the marriage and I started devoting my time and energy to the child and household. \r\nSomehow I still felt a stranger in my new environ. I could not even connect with my husband as he never saved me from the barbs of the family. \r\nThen I had another daughter and another. \r\nIn 1980,we came to Delhi on transfer. \r\nWhen my youngest daughter was 3 and started going to school, I felt as if I had no meaning in life. There was such a vacuum in my life and I was undergoing extreme sort of depression. It seemed as if I had no meaning left to live now and thought of even ending my life. \r\nMy chance meeting with the renowned journalist and writer brought a new turn to my life. \r\nI met him at his house and related all my woes. While returning home, he gave a bunch of books including one of his own short story collection - Mark of Vishnu. \r\nAfter a few days I received a post card from Khushwant Ji. He had written -\r\nIt's sinful to corrode life like this.. You start reading and writing as I have seen a great potential in you, the way you explained your story. \r\nYou will soon realize how beautiful life is and how much it can offer you. \r\nTears were flowing from my eyes and I made a resolve - I will start writing. \r\nMy first book published by one of the best Hindi publisher Rajkamal Prakashan was the translation of Mr Khushwant Singh's short stories 'प्रतिनिधि कहानियां ' in 1989.\r\nThen came my own short story collection शोषित और अन्य कहानियां in 1990.\r\nAfter that I never looked back and today have 28 books to my credit and my short story collectionऔरतें  was taught at Bonn University in 2009.

I would love to share the first time I inspired myself: I had just passed my class X board exams with distinction and was asked by my teachers to apply for the National Merit Scholarship. I was ranked in the merit list and only needed to submit the marksheet attested by a Gazzetted Govt Officer. In was in 1980.  I went and approached a govt officer. He without looking at my marksheet, asked what my parents did. I told him politely that I lost my father early and mother was a school teacher. With lot of pride, the officer asked me learn typing and to join a clerks job after passing class XII. He said that by doing so , I could help my mother financially to make my brother study!!! That was perhaps the turning point of my life! I took my marksheet from him and walked out telling him politely that just because I was a girl , I  needn't necessarily become a clerk. I had the merit to become a Gazzetted officer and I also told him that someday I would certainly become an officer who is competent to attest marksheets/ documents. \nI and my attitude was my inspiration at that point of time and as on date I am serving as a senior Civil Service officer.",

She not only provided time to kids but always stood next to her husband to boost his moral and being available always as and when he is  needed her in business . Despite being suffering from rheumatism she has always given priority to kids and husband business . She is a struggler and it inspires me a lot to never stop and always keep moving in life .",

        "description": "I learn from her that how to fight with all wrongs and build yourself. During our stay in Saudi arabia she want to get a job in such a conservative environment where womens are not even allowed to go anywhere alone. She clear the medical exam after lot of struggle like travelling, study with friends online. And then the most hard part os to visit different hospitals by her own, meet the people to get the job. When she was selected for one job, lot of documentation from India and finally her joining as a full time dentist. The whole journey was a surprise for me where she face all odds and get her dream job. Where the society belongs to men and women dont get any support.",

She also was involved in efforts to ban land mines. To ensure that William and Harry had “an understanding of people’s emotions, their insecurities, people’s distress, and their hopes and dreams,” Diana brought her sons with her to hospitals, homeless shelters, and orphanages. To acquaint them with the world outside royal privilege, she took them to fast food restaurants and on public transportation. Her compassion, personal warmth, humility, and accessibility earned her the sobriquet “the People’s Princess.”",
